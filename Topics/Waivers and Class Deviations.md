## Summary

CMMC waivers apply to entire contracts, not individual companies, and the waiver decision is a pre-solicitation process. Once a solicitation is issued with CMMC requirements, it is too late to obtain a waiver. Summit 7 predicts no waivers will be granted during Phase 1, as the DoD will not kick off the program by making concessions -- especially given the delayed start from the government shutdown.

## Key Facts

- Waivers are for **entire contracts**, not for individual companies
- The waiver decision to remove CMMC requirements is a **pre-solicitation process** -- by the time a company sees the requirement, it cannot be changed
- Summit 7 predicts **no waivers in Phase 1** -- the DoD will not start the program with concessions
- Some DoD components may opt for self-assessment over certification (bending the rules), but this is not a waiver
- No DoD component is expected to completely remove CMMC requirements from solicitations
- Betting on waivers, extensions, or special treatment is described as "an astronomically unlikely scenario" and "a multi-leg parlay that I don't think is going to hit"
- No budget, no appropriations in Phase 1 -- "Get out and do it"

### Northrop Grumman Supplier Letter (December 2025)

Northrop Grumman published a supplier announcement titled "CMMC 2.0 is final. Are you ready?" that explicitly states:
- "Neither contracting officers nor prime contractors may waive or deviate from the CMMC cybersecurity control and assessment requirements"
- "Contracting officers may not award contracts to non-compliant contractors and prime contractors may not award purchase orders to non-compliant subcontractors"
- "We encourage you to proactively prepare to comply with this future contractual requirement"

The letter confirms that primes do not control the waiver process -- it happens before the contracting officer or prime is involved.

## How It Works

### Waiver Process
1. Waivers are decided **before** a solicitation is issued
2. A waiver removes CMMC requirements from an entire contract -- it does not exempt individual companies
3. Once the solicitation is published with CMMC requirements, there is no mechanism for a company to request an individual waiver
4. The contracting officer or program manager makes the waiver decision during the pre-solicitation phase

### Detailed Waiver Approval Chain (from 32 CFR 170 and January 2025 Memo)

Per 32 CFR 170 section 170.5 and the January 2025 implementing memo from the under secretaries of defense:

1. **Program managers or requiring activities** initiate the waiver request
2. Request is coordinated through the **component Chief Information Officer (CIO)** -- who reports to the DoD CIO (which runs the CMMC program)
3. The **service acquisition executive or component acquisition executive** makes the final approval decision
4. Neither **contracting officers** nor **prime contractors** are part of this chain -- the waiver decision happens before they are involved

Key constraints from the January 2025 memo:
- **CMMC Level 1:** No waivers available
- **CMMC Level 2 self-assessment:** No waivers available
- **CMMC Level 2 C3PAO:** Waivers will be "rare" per the memo
- Approved waivers on a class basis must include a **planned expiration date** (they are temporary)
- Subsequent solicitations must include guidance for **requiring CMMC certification** -- only the first round of awards goes out without it
- The solicitation must include a requirement to submit **alternate protection plans** for securing FCI and CUI, and those plans must be evaluated as part of the selection process
- Waivers may be requested for an **individual procurement** or an **entire class of procurements**

### What May Happen Instead of Waivers
- Some DoD components may choose to require self-assessment instead of C3PAO certification -- technically allowed but risky to bet on
- Some program managers may try to delay including CMMC in their solicitations
- These variations are situational and unpredictable -- they should not form the basis of a compliance strategy

*(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], Summit 7, November 2025)*

### Once in a Solicitation -- No Waiver Possible

Per 32 CFR 170 section 170.3: "Once applicable to a solicitation, there is no process for organizations to seek waivers of CMMC requirements from the DoD CIO." If you are waiting until you see CMMC in a solicitation to consider it a real requirement, it has already been determined that:
1. There will be enough companies to meet the requirement
2. No waivers will be granted for that contract

*(Source: [[Primes Can't Waive CMMC]], Summit 7, December 2025)*

### Underlying Requirements Survive Any Waiver

Even if a CMMC assessment requirement is waived for a contract, contractors and subcontractors **remain obligated** to comply with:
- **FAR 52.204-21** (basic safeguarding of FCI)
- **[[DFARS Clauses and Legal Requirements|DFARS 252.204-7012]]** (CUI protection, NIST 800-171)
- **DFARS 252.204-7020** (DIBCAC audit authority)

A CMMC waiver only removes the third-party assessment requirement -- it does not remove the underlying cybersecurity obligations. Waiting for a waiver to avoid compliance with DFARS 7012 is a fundamental misunderstanding of what waivers cover.

## Decision Criteria

- Do not plan your compliance strategy around receiving a waiver
- Do not delay compliance hoping for extensions or special treatment
- If a solicitation includes CMMC requirements, you must meet them -- there is no appeals process for individual companies
- Check what your prime contractor requires, as their timeline may be more aggressive than DoD's

| Individual companies can request CMMC waivers | Waivers apply to entire contracts and are decided pre-solicitation; individual companies cannot request them | [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]] |
| Phase 1 will be lenient with waivers since the program just started | Summit 7 predicts zero waivers in Phase 1; DoD will not start the program with concessions | [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]] |
| Delaying and hoping for extensions is a viable strategy | This is described as a "multi-leg parlay" and "astronomically unlikely scenario" -- do not bet your company on it | [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]] |
| My prime contractor can waive CMMC for me | Neither contracting officers nor prime contractors may waive CMMC requirements; the waiver process happens before they are involved | [[Primes Can't Waive CMMC]] |
| If CMMC is waived, I don't need to do cybersecurity | A CMMC waiver only removes the assessment requirement; FAR 52.204-21, DFARS 7012, and DFARS 7020 obligations remain | [[Primes Can't Waive CMMC]] |
| I can get a waiver after I see CMMC in a solicitation | Once CMMC is in a solicitation, there is no process to seek a waiver; waivers are pre-solicitation only | [[Primes Can't Waive CMMC]] |
| Level 1 and Level 2 self-assessment requirements can be waived | Per the January 2025 memo, there are no waivers for Level 1 or Level 2 self-assessment | [[Primes Can't Waive CMMC]] |

### Class Deviations Explained

A **class deviation** is a formal temporary authorization that allows federal agencies to bypass, alter, or ignore parts of the FAR or agency supplements (like the DFARS) without going through the full rulemaking process. Key characteristics:

- **Purpose:** Implement new policies, legislative changes, or meet urgent requirements across multiple solicitations and contracts
- **Scope:** Apply to an entire "class" of solicitations and contracts (as opposed to individual deviations for a single negotiation)
- **Mechanism:** Instruct contracting officers to omit, replace, or insert specific clause language in place of what is currently codified in Title 48 of the CFR
- **Duration:** Remain in effect until rescinded or until the text is officially incorporated via rulemaking
- **Visibility:** Class deviation text does **not** appear when you Google the clause number at Title 48 -- you will still see the old codified text until rulemaking catches up

**Notable CMMC-related class deviations:**

| Deviation | Date | What It Did |
|---|---|---|
| **2025-O0006** | August 2025 | Instructed contracting officers not to use DFARS 7021 clause until CMMC 2.0 final rule effective date (November 10, 2025), preventing insertion of outdated CMMC 1.0 clause text |
| **2024-O0013** | May 2024 | Addressed the DFARS 7012 versioning issue -- directs use of NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 instead of "most current version" (Rev 3), aligning with CMMC's pinned version |
| **February 2026 DFARS deviations (38 total)** | February 1, 2026 | Part of the Revolutionary FAR Overhaul; includes renumbering FAR 52.204-21 to 52.240-93, deleting DFARS 7019, and renumbering DFARS 7020 to 7997 with basic self-assessment removed |

### Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO)

In August 2025, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy launched the **Revolutionary FAR Overhaul** -- the first major overhaul and the largest single update to the Federal Acquisition Regulation in its 40-year history. The policy basis:

- **Executive Order 14275** -- "Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement"
- **Executive Order 14265** -- "Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base"
- **OMB Memorandum M-25-26** -- "Overhauling Federal Acquisition Regulation"

The goal is to rewrite the FAR in plain language and **eliminate up to one-third** of its content -- removing text that is not required by statute, executive order, or essential to sound procurement. Every single part of the FAR has gone under the microscope, with changes published on the RFO website.

The overhaul is being implemented through **class deviations first** so agencies can use streamlined language immediately, rather than waiting for the slow rulemaking process. Eventually, all changes will go through rulemaking as a **gigantic omnibus** -- pushing the entire FAR revision through at once. The FAR CUI rule is expected to be included in this omnibus.

**Impact on CMMC:** The cybersecurity requirements survived the overhaul intact. They were renumbered and streamlined but **not eliminated**. As Summit 7 noted: "If there was ever an opportunity where they were going to kind of cut some things that people really didn't want, this was going to be it. And that is not what happened." The CMMC "haters" who hoped the FAR overhaul would kill the program have been proven wrong -- cybersecurity requirements are clearly considered essential to procurement.

## Open Questions / Debates

- **Will some DoD components bend the rules?** Summit 7 says yes -- some may opt for self-assessment over certification to ease the transition. But this is unpredictable and should not be relied upon. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], November 2025)*
- **How long will the "ghost clauses" issue persist?** Class deviations have changed clause numbers (e.g., FAR 52.204-21 is now 52.240-93), but CMMC materials still reference the old numbers. This will not be normalized until rulemaking completes -- estimated 2+ years. *(Source: [[The End of SPRS Scores (sort of)]], February 2026)*
