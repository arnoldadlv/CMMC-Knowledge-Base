## Summary

The Department of Justice's Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative, announced in October 2021, uses the False Claims Act to pursue defense contractors who misrepresent their cybersecurity compliance. In March 2025, a 150-person defense contractor settled for $4.6 million over false SPRS scores and failure to comply with DFARS 7012 -- the first major FCA settlement against a small DIB company. There are approximately 100 similar cases pending in the DOJ system.

## Key Facts

- **$4.6 million settlement** (March 2025) against a ~150-person defense contractor with Army and Air Force contracts
- The company submitted a [[SPRS and Annual Affirmation|SPRS]] score of **104** (out of 110 max) when their actual score was **negative 142** -- a 246-point discrepancy
- The whistleblower (former head of security) received **$851,000** (18.5% of the settlement)
- The company also had to pay **$198,000** in the whistleblower's legal fees as part of the settlement
- Payment terms: **$1 million within 14 days**, **$3.6 million within 60 days** -- no payment plan
- The settlement resolved violations occurring between **2018 and 2023**
- The company had fixed their compliance by 2024 (achieving a 110 score) -- **but still owed $4.6M for the prior violations**
- **~100 similar cases** are currently pending in the DOJ system
- The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative is a Biden-era program that continues under the current administration
- FCA penalties do **not scale by company size** -- a 150-person company paid $4.6M, similar to Verizon's $4.1M GSA settlement in 2023
- Per-claim civil penalties range from **$12,500 to $25,000** (adjusted for inflation), plus **treble damages** (3x the government's damages)

- **Swiss Automation Incorporated** settled for **$421,234** in December 2025 -- the 5th cybersecurity FCA settlement in 2025
- Swiss Automation is a **~300 person company** whose fine stemmed from a handful of purchase orders for machined parts supplied to DoD contractors
- The whistleblower was the company's **quality manager** (not IT staff) who received **$65,000** for blowing the whistle
- **All five 2025 cybersecurity FCA settlements:**
  1. **Morse Corp** -- $4.6M settlement (March 2025), whistleblower received 18.5% (~$851K)
  2. **Raytheon/Nightwing** -- $8.4M settlement (May 2025), whistleblower received ~$1.5M
  3. **AeroTurbine** -- $1.75M settlement (July 2025), self-reported by PE firm that committed the violation
  4. **Georgia Tech Research Corporation** -- $875K settlement (September 2025), whistleblower received $21K
  5. **Swiss Automation (Illinois Precision)** -- $421K settlement (December 2025), whistleblower received $65K
- **4 out of 5** cybersecurity FCA settlements in 2025 had whistleblowers who walked away with significant payouts
- **$2.9 billion** in total DOJ FCA recoveries (all types) in fiscal year 2025 -- cybersecurity is a tiny but growing fraction
- The [[False Claims Act and DOJ Enforcement|False Claims Act]] dates back to **1863**, enacted during the Civil War in response to defense contractor fraud
- Whistleblowers (relators) receive **10-30%** of the fine under the FCA's whistleblower provision
- DOJ launched the **Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative in 2021** and cyber FCA settlements have increased every year since

## How It Works

### The False Claims Act (FCA)
- The government's primary civil tool to address false claims for federal funds
- Includes a **whistleblower provision** allowing private parties to assist in identifying fraud and share in recovery
- Whistleblowers are protected from retaliation
- Violators are liable for **treble damages** (3x government damages) plus per-claim civil penalties ($12,500-$25,000, inflation-adjusted)
- "Knowingly" is a specific legal term -- it means you could have known, not that you deliberately intended to deceive

### The "Knowingly" Standard in Detail (Don Stern, DLA Piper)

Per Don Stern, co-chair of government contracts at DLA Piper and former DOJ trial attorney, the FCA's "knowingly" standard includes three categories:

1. **Actual knowledge** -- you knew the representation was false
2. **Reckless disregard** -- you did not take reasonable steps to determine accuracy (e.g., spending five minutes checking boxes on 110 controls without diligence)
3. **Deliberate ignorance** -- you buried your head in the sand and chose not to investigate

The practical implication: checking boxes in five minutes without due diligence -- without having the legal side, business side, and IT side genuinely evaluate compliance -- can constitute "reckless disregard" under the FCA. The defense against FCA liability is **documentation of rationale**. If you are diligent, if you document the basis for your decisions, if you go through the process with reasonable care given your knowledge and expertise, that is generally an adequate defense even if you later discover you missed the mark. The story of "I spent time, documented my reasoning, and a gap assessment later revealed issues" is far more defensible than "I spent five minutes checking boxes."

Stern emphasizes that the government has made "no secret" of using the FCA to review cybersecurity compliance. The shift from the early "kumbaya" era of CMMC -- where government and industry were working together to protect information -- to active FCA enforcement means companies must treat compliance representations with the same rigor as any other material contract representation.

### The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative (October 2021)
The DOJ announced this initiative to "utilize the False Claims Act to pursue cybersecurity-related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients." It targets entities that:
1. Knowingly provide deficient cybersecurity products or services
2. Knowingly misrepresent their cybersecurity practices or protocols
3. Knowingly violate obligations to monitor and report cyber incidents and breaches

### Case Study: Small Defense Contractor FCA Settlement (2025)

**Timeline:**
- **2016:** DFARS 252.204-7012 revised to require NIST SP 800-171 implementation
- **2018-2023:** Period of alleged violations
- **2020:** DFARS 7019/7020 rule creates SPRS scoring and self-assessment requirements
- **January 2021:** Company hires head of security; submits SPRS score of 104
- **March 2021:** DoD pauses CMMC program for strategic review
- **October 2021:** DOJ announces Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative
- **Summer 2022:** Third-party consultant tells company their actual score is **negative 142**; company does **not update** their SPRS score
- **January 2023:** Head of security leaves, lawyers up, files whistleblower complaint
- **March 2023:** Less than 60 days later, company is served DOJ subpoena
- **June 2023:** Company updates SPRS score to 57; later updates to 82 in October
- **Spring 2024:** Company achieves a perfect SPRS score of 110
- **March 2025:** Company settles for $4.6 million plus interest

**What They Admitted To:**
1. From 2018-2022, used a third-party email host without ensuring FedRAMP Moderate (or equivalent) compliance, violating DFARS 7012 paragraphs C through G
2. From 2018-2023, had not fully implemented NIST SP 800-171 controls as required by DFARS 7012 paragraph B
3. From 2018-2021, had **no consolidated written system security plan (SSP)** for their covered information systems -- and you cannot calculate a valid SPRS score without an SSP
4. Submitted a score of 104 to SPRS, learned the real score was negative 142, and did not update until after being served a subpoena

### Whistleblower Outcomes
- The whistleblower in this case received $851,000
- The Georgia Tech whistleblower, AirJet/Rocketdyne whistleblower, and this case whistleblower all have jobs after blowing the whistle
- Whistleblower payouts range from $800,000 to several million dollars based on available data
- Whistleblower legal fees were paid by the company ($198,000) as part of the settlement
- Summit 7 has spoken directly with whistleblowers from multiple cases -- "they're doing just fine"

### 2025 Whistleblower Summary (All Five Cyber FCA Cases)

| Case | Settlement | Whistleblower Payout | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Morse Corp (March) | $4.6M | ~$851K (18.5%) | Plus $198K legal fees paid by company |
| Raytheon/Nightwing (May) | $8.4M | ~$1.5M | |
| AeroTurbine (July) | $1.75M | N/A (self-reported) | PE firm committed violation; company self-reported |
| Georgia Tech (September) | $875K | $21K | |
| Swiss Automation (December) | $421K | $65K | Quality manager blew whistle; ~300 person company |

- Every whistleblower from these cases who blew the whistle and received a payday is **still employed** to this day
- The biggest insider risk for non-compliant companies is their **own employees** -- they are "highly incentivized to blow the whistle and go after this payday"
- The Swiss Automation whistleblower was the **quality manager**, not the IT person -- anyone in the company with knowledge can be the whistleblower

### The Cost Math
- **Six-figure cost to implement and comply** vs. **seven-figure fine if you don't**
- $100K implementation cost vs. $4.6M settlement = **46 years' worth** of implementation costs
- Would you rather spend 7% of your annual budget on security, or 670% on a penalty?
- 99% of companies would go out of business if told to write a $1M check in two weeks

## Decision Criteria

- **You have a SPRS score that does not reflect reality** --> Update it immediately; not updating after learning the truth was the pivotal mistake in this case
- **You handle CUI without full NIST 800-171 implementation** --> You are in the same risk category as this company; every day of non-compliance is exposure
- **You use a cloud provider without FedRAMP Moderate** --> This was one of the specific admissions in the settlement
- **You do not have an SSP** --> You cannot have a valid SPRS score without one; this was another specific admission
- **Someone inside your company is raising compliance concerns** --> Address them; the only thing preventing an FCA case "is someone inside your company not calling this law firm right now"

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FCA penalties scale by company size | Penalties are based on contract value and number of violations, not company size; a 150-person company paid $4.6M, similar to Verizon's $4.1M | [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]] |
| Fixing the problem makes the past violations go away | The company achieved a perfect 110 score by 2024 but still owed $4.6M for 2018-2023 violations | [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]] |
| Whistleblowers get burned and don't get paid | All known CMMC/cyber FCA whistleblowers have jobs and received $800K-$2M+ payouts | [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]] |
| The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative was a Biden-era thing that will go away | The initiative continues under the current administration; enforcement quotes are uniformly aggressive | [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]] |
| This only happens to big companies | This settlement was specifically against a 150-person company -- the first small DIB company case | [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]] |
| "Knowingly" means you have to intend to deceive | "Knowingly" includes reckless disregard and deliberate ignorance -- spending five minutes checking boxes without diligence can qualify. Documentation of rationale is the critical defense. | [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]], [[When CMMC Meets Contracts]] |

### GAO Protest Risk from Non-Compliance

Beyond FCA liability, CMMC non-compliance creates a **GAO protest risk** in competitive procurements:

- If a company wins a contract but is not CMMC certified, competitors can file a **GAO protest immediately**
- The easiest way to discover non-compliance is to **look up the competitor's DNS records** -- if email is still pointed to non-FedRAMP clouds, they are potentially non-compliant
- Email is **typically in scope** for CMMC, making DNS record checks a simple indicator of compliance posture
- A competitor self-attesting to a perfect 110 CMMC L2 score while running on commercial infrastructure is vulnerable to protest based on publicly available information
- McGlachlin (cybersecurity attorney, former Navy CI officer): "If I'm representing a company that competed against you and I didn't get the contract and I get wind that you're not CMMC certified, the first thing I'm doing is going to the GAO and filing a protest immediately"

## Open Questions / Debates

- **Will the 100 pending cases result in similar settlements?** Summit 7 believes yes. The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative has bipartisan support and the current administration is focused on fraud. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]], April 2025)*
- **Is this getting enough attention?** Summit 7 argues emphatically no. Their LinkedIn post about DOJ going after universities got 100,000 views; this case got 10. "This is not getting enough attention." *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]], April 2025)*
- **Will GAO protests become a primary enforcement mechanism?** McGlachlin suggests competitors can easily identify non-compliance via publicly available information (DNS records, cloud infrastructure) and file protests. This may become a market-driven enforcement mechanism alongside DOJ/FCA. *(Source: [[Where Cybersecurity Meets Legal]], February 2026)*
