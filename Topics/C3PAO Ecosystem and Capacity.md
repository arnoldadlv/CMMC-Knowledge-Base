## Summary
C3PAOs (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organizations) conduct CMMC Level 2 assessments. A strict firewall exists between advisory/consulting services and assessment services -- a C3PAO cannot consult with a company and then assess them. Mock assessments are a key role C3PAOs play, giving companies a risk-free dry run before the real assessment.

## Key Facts
- The C3PAO **cannot consult** during the assessment -- this is a strict separation of concerns
- If your assessor starts giving advice during an assessment, that is a red flag
- Advisory services and assessment services must be performed by **separate teams or organizations**
- A C3PAO can conduct a mock assessment, but a **different team** from that C3PAO must conduct the real assessment
- Mock assessments follow the same format as real assessments but do not get reported to SPRS

## How It Works
### The C3PAO Firewall Rule
The firewall between consulting and assessment is one of the most important structural rules in CMMC:
- A C3PAO that has provided consulting or advisory services to a company **cannot** then assess that same company
- Within a single C3PAO, different teams can handle mock vs. real assessments, but the same individuals cannot cross over
- This prevents conflicts of interest where an assessor might pass a company they helped prepare

### Mock Assessment Role
C3PAOs play a critical dual role in the ecosystem:
1. **Mock assessments** -- Same format as the real thing, identifies gaps, no SPRS reporting, protects the company
2. **Certification assessments** -- The official two-phase process that results in a CMMC certification decision

The mock assessment is the single best preparation tool available. It gives you the experience of a real assessment without the risk of a failed record.

## Decision Criteria
- **Choosing a C3PAO for assessment** --> Ensure they have not provided consulting services to your organization
- **Want a mock assessment from the same C3PAO?** --> Allowed, but a different team must conduct the real assessment
- **Assessor giving advice during your assessment?** --> This is a red flag and a violation of the firewall rule

## Common Misconceptions
| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Your C3PAO consultant can also be your assessor | Strict firewall -- advisory and assessment must be separate | [[CMMC Assessment Process - What to Expect]] |
| Mock assessments go on your record | Mock assessments do not get reported to SPRS | [[CMMC Assessment Process - What to Expect]] |
| You do not need a mock assessment if you feel ready | Many companies that feel prepared still get stopped at Phase 1 -- mocks have no downside | [[CMMC Assessment Process - What to Expect]] |

### Ecosystem Growth (December 2024 - End of 2025)

The C3PAO ecosystem grew from zero to approximately 100 authorized organizations in a single year, entirely during the voluntary "market rollout" period before any contract required CMMC.

**Assessment Capacity Numbers (End of 2025 Projections):**
- **~100 C3PAOs** authorized (up from zero in December 2024)
- **~1,400 certified practitioners**
- **~700 certified assessors**
- **~400 lead assessors** -- the primary constraint on the number of assessment teams
- Even 200-400 assessment teams represents significant initial capacity for Phase 1

**Certification Growth:**
- **450+ Level 2 certifications** as of October 2025 (includes final and conditional status)
- **280% increase** since May 2025
- Projected **~700 Level 2 certifications** by end of 2025
- Projected **1,000-1,500 Level 2 certifications** by end of Q1 2026
- All certifications through 2025 were voluntary -- no contract required them
- Monthly assessment output growing at approximately **66% rate**

**Growth Predictions (Phase 1):**
- Summit 7 predicts at least **200 authorized C3PAOs** by end of Phase 1 (November 2026)
- Assessment capacity expected to continue accelerating once contracts begin requiring CMMC

### C3PAO Perspective: Fernando Machado (December 2024)

Fernando Machado -- provisional assessor #8 and the 29th authorized C3PAO (authorized in 2022) -- provides a ground-level view of C3PAO demand and assessment realities:

**Backlog and Demand:**
- As of December 2024, Machado's C3PAO was **booked out through August 2025** -- a full 8-month backlog
- This was not a one-person bottleneck: his entire assessment team was booked through August
- Approximately **60% of booked companies are small** (under 200 employees), with the other **40% medium-to-large**

**Assessment Cost Reality:**
- Fernando directly debunked the "$100K assessment cost" myth: **none of his booked assessments were expected to crack $100K**
- Cost depends on scope and company size, but **$100K is not the starting point** for the average DIB contractor at 250 employees or less
- The $100K figure originated from an uncontextualized quote years earlier and has been widely repeated without basis

**MSPs as Force Multipliers:**
- MSPs are "force multipliers" for assessments -- a fully MSP-supported assessment with a clear [[CRM (Customer Responsibility Matrix)|CRM]] ran smoothly
- A **certified MSP** means the MSP does not need to be present at the assessment table, saving time and cost
- However, when an OSC says "our MSP will handle everything," that is a red flag -- shared responsibility must be clearly delineated

**Recommendations for Companies Not Yet Ready:**
- **Start booking C3PAOs now**, even if you are not assessment-ready -- make reservation agreements and get in line
- The average readiness timeline is **8-12 months**, so booking and readiness preparation should happen in tandem
- Ensure your **C3PAO and consultant are talking to each other** before the assessment -- the time to discover disagreements is not during the assessment itself

### Why Third-Party Model Was Necessary
- DIBCAC could never hire enough FTEs to assess the entire DIB -- they do not run anywhere near 400 assessment teams
- Even under the reduced assessment numbers of CMMC 2.0, government-only assessment was infeasible
- The third-party C3PAO system was the only way to scale assessment capacity
- The system is working: as of late 2025, nobody who needed an assessment has been unable to get one

### False Starts vs. Failures
- Assessment **failure rates are very low** -- single-digit percentages
- However, **25-40% of companies** that signed up for voluntary assessments were told to "come back later" -- not ready
- These "false starts" happen in Phase 1 of the assessment (readiness check) and are not tracked as failures by the government or Cyber AB
- One C3PAO described it as: "We want you to pass, but we can't just let you pass" -- the readiness gaps were so severe they could not even accept payment to run the assessment
- The low failure rate is partly because false starts filter out unready companies before they formally begin

### Dual Bottleneck: MSP Readiness + C3PAO Scheduling

The bottleneck in the CMMC ecosystem is more complex than just C3PAO capacity:

- **C3PAOs are suspending assessments** because companies cannot produce basic documentation like an SSP -- the bottleneck is happening before companies ever reach the assessment
- Real story: a company delivered a **20-slide PowerPoint deck** to their assessor and said "this is my SSP" -- the assessor had to turn them away
- The **MSP onboarding bottleneck** is equally significant: MSPs cannot bring companies to a compliance-ready state fast enough to fill the C3PAO assessment calendar
- Companies turned away face a compounding delay: **3-4 months** to get MSP help, then **back in line** for a new C3PAO assessment date scheduled months out
- Mike McGlachlin (cybersecurity attorney): with ~100 C3PAOs for ~300,000 DIB companies needing certification by 2028, "the numbers just don't add up"

## Open Questions / Debates

- **Will capacity keep pace with demand?** Summit 7 is confident current growth trajectories are sufficient, but demand will spike sharply as Phase 1 contracts require CMMC. Whether C3PAO growth can match is uncertain. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], November 2025)*
- **Is the real bottleneck MSP readiness, not C3PAO capacity?** Assessment suspensions due to documentation failures suggest the constraint is companies reaching assessment-readiness, not the number of available assessors. *(Source: [[Where Cybersecurity Meets Legal]], February 2026)*
