## Summary
CMMC Phase 1 rollout is underway, with contracts already appearing that include DFARS 7021 language. NAVAIR has been cited as an early adopter. Beyond direct DoD contract language, prime contractors are independently pressuring their supply chains with compliance deadlines, creating a dual enforcement wave.

## Key Facts
- Phase 1 of CMMC rollout is **currently underway** -- contracts with DFARS 7021 are being issued
- **NAVAIR** has been cited as an early adopter, with other agencies following
- Prime contractors are sending compliance deadline letters to subcontractors
- Some primes are requiring evidence of CMMC readiness as a condition of continuing the relationship
- The enforcement wave from primes is estimated at **12-24 months out** from widespread implementation
- The "it'll blow over" crowd is running out of runway
- **December 2024:** CMMC program officially went into effect; voluntary assessments began but DoD could not require CMMC in contracts
- **November 10, 2025:** CMMC contract clause language became effective; CMMC status is now a condition of contract award
- **Phase 1** (November 2025 - November 2026): Officially focused on Level 2 self-assessments, but early solicitations already exceed this
- **Phase 2** (November 2026 - November 2027): Level 3 requirements at department discretion
- CMMC status is now "officially and will forever be a condition of contract award"
- The government shutdown in early November 2025 caused a staggered start to Phase 1
- The "market rollout" period (Dec 2024 - Nov 2025) saw over 450 voluntary certifications before any contract required CMMC
- Summit 7 observed solicitations requiring C3PAO certification within days of Phase 1 starting

*(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], Summit 7, November 2025)*

- **7 SAM.gov notices** appeared since September 10, 2025 (48 CFR publication date) referencing CMMC requirements -- during a government shutdown when activity was minimal
- Notices span vastly different industries: microelectronics/semiconductor manufacturing, construction, roofing, bulk fuel storage, hydroelectric infrastructure, and administrative/consulting support
- **Navy NAVSEA** semiconductor RFI requires CMMC Level 2 for US onshore 300mm wafer production fabrication capability (ITAR-compliant, radiation-hardened memory microcircuits)
- **US SOCOM** global services delivery notice requires Level 1 with full supply chain requirement -- primes will be **disqualified** if any identified subcontractor/team member does not also meet CMMC Level 1
- **Army Corps of Engineers** GBSD Sentinel operations group facilities at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming requires Level 2 C3PAO certification with anticipated FY27 award -- the timeline is driven by **contract award timing**, not phase rollout
- **Army Corps of Engineers Japan District** issued notice that all solicitations after November 10 will require CMMC Level 1 certification minimum for all offerings
- Army Corps is seeking to "minimize proposed variations or substitutions during the solicitation bidder inquiry period" -- bad news for companies planning to request waivers
- Other Army Corps notices: semiconductor test labs at White Sands Missile Range (NM), John Day Dam turbine runner replacement (Rufus, OR -- hydroelectric), housing revitalization in Yokosuka Japan, bulk fuel storage at Yokota Air Base Japan
- **Government shutdown compresses timeline** but does not change deadlines -- solicitations delayed by the shutdown will still have the same award deadlines, giving contractors even less preparation time
- Phase rollout does **NOT** prohibit Level 2 requirements during Phase 1 -- it is entirely at DoD's discretion
- Risk appetite varies by individual program manager, component, and service branch -- this is not a monolithic DoD decision

## How It Works
### Phase 1 -- Current Status
Contracts are already appearing with CMMC Level 2 requirements via DFARS 7021. This is not a future event -- it is happening now. NAVAIR has been identified as one of the first agencies to include 7021 language in active contracts.

### Prime Contractor Pressure
The enforcement wave is not coming exclusively from DoD. Primes are independently pushing compliance down through the supply chain:
- Letters with specific compliance deadlines are being sent to subcontractors
- Some primes require evidence of CMMC readiness to continue the subcontractor relationship
- This creates a **dual pressure source**: DoD contract language from above, prime contractor demands from the side

This means even if DFARS 7021 has not yet appeared in your specific contract, your prime may already be demanding action.

### CMMC Level 2 Required to Even View RFI Details

In an unprecedented early use of CMMC as an acquisition control tool, a UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) program required **CMMC Level 2 attainment just to access the defining characteristics** of the next RFI:

- The next phase of UAS capability trials gated RFI participation behind Level 2 proof
- This represents contracting officers using CMMC to **cut the signal-to-noise ratio** -- if you cannot prove Level 2, you cannot even see what the requirement is
- Ryan Bonner: "Wasn't expecting CMMC as a possible tool for program managers and contracting officers to control outcomes"
- This is the **earliest known use** of CMMC as a pre-qualification filter for RFIs (not just RFPs or contract awards)
- Expect this pattern to spread: contracting officers who had to review 10,000 proposals now have a built-in filter

### Supply Chain Dynamics -- Silence Is the Danger Signal

Subcontractors report a spectrum of responses from primes:

- **The dangerous signal**: Hearing nothing from your prime customer. This may mean they have already removed you from vendor lists, stopped planning to use you, or are actively seeking replacements. "They don't have to say anything -- they can just stop calling you."
- **The positive signal**: "The reason you are getting more work right now is because you have your certification" -- clear linkage between CMMC attainment and work allocation
- **Board-level urgency**: Supply chain risk management inquiries ("where are you at? what date will you be done?") are driving executive/board-level discussions, with specific compliance dates tied to revenue commitments made to primes
- **Competent implementer backlog**: The backlog to get into a compliance state prior to assessment may be longer than the assessment backlog itself -- MSP Collective has ~30 certified MSPs vs. ~300,000 DIB organizations

*(Source: [[CUI Hotline - Weekly Q&A with Ryan Bonner (Jan 24 2026)]], Summit 7, January 2026)*

### Supplier Announcements and Notifications (Late 2025)

Since the 48 CFR CMMC final rule was published in September 2025 and the contract clause language became effective on **November 10, 2025**, all major primes have been sending supplier notices:
- **Lockheed Martin**, **RTX (Raytheon)**, **BAE Systems**, **HII (Huntington Ingalls)**, **Northrop Grumman** -- all have issued supplier letters, webinars, or notices about CMMC readiness
- Northrop Grumman's supplier announcement ("CMMC 2.0 is final. Are you ready?") explicitly states: "Contracting officers may not award contracts to non-compliant contractors" and "prime contractors may not award purchase orders to non-compliant subcontractors"
- Northrop's letter cites the **November 10, 2025** effective date: "Starting on November 10th, 2025, contracting officers may add the DFARS clauses to solicitations and contracts with immediate compliance requirements"
- Summit 7 reports that these supplier announcements have driven **more inquiries about CMMC than any of the rulemaking milestones** -- "final rule comes out, goes into effect, crickets. Lockheed sends a letter, everybody scrambles"
- The letters encourage suppliers to "proactively prepare to comply with this future contractual requirement"

*(Source: [[Primes Can't Waive CMMC]], Summit 7, December 2025)*

### Prime Contractor Acceleration (Phase 1 Detail)
Primes are telling subcontractors to get ready now, regardless of the DoD phased rollout:
- Primes cannot wait for the rollout timeline -- they need supply chain readiness before contracts require it
- Since most DIB companies work for primes (not directly for DoD), **what the prime requires matters more than what DoD says the phase should be**
- Primes' reasoning: "We don't know if or when you need the CUI, and by the time we do know, we can't wait for you to then turn around and take 18 months to get ready"
- A company was selected by Lockheed specifically because "we know you already have CMMC taken care of"
- If you have not asked your prime about their CMMC timeline recently, do so now -- it may be very different from the DoD phased rollout guidance

### Phase Timeline Detail
1. **Market Rollout** (Dec 2024 - Nov 2025): Voluntary assessments only; DoD could not require CMMC in contracts
2. **Phase 1** (Nov 10, 2025 - Nov 2026): Contract clause language effective; CMMC required in new solicitations
3. **Phase 2** (Nov 2026 - Nov 2027): Level 3 at department discretion
4. **Phase 3-4**: Full rollout across all applicable contracts

### What DoD Said vs. Reality
- Phase 1 was supposed to focus only on Level 1 and Level 2 self-assessments
- Nothing prevents DoD or primes from requiring Level 2 C3PAO certification or even Level 3 during Phase 1
- The phased rollout text was written long before recent policy developments (e.g., Golden Dome memo) that may accelerate requirements
- There is no statutory limit preventing higher-level requirements in earlier phases -- the phased rollout was guidance, not law

*(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], Summit 7, November 2025)*

### The 96% Problem and Readiness
The most engaged CMMC community represents only 2-4% of the companies that need Level 2. The other 96% are not self-educating, creating a massive readiness gap as contracts begin requiring certification. See [[CMMC Levels and Framework Structure]] for details.

## Decision Criteria
- **7021 already in your contract** --> You need CMMC certification now
- **7021 not yet in your contract but you handle CUI** --> Prepare now; it is being added to contracts and your prime may demand it within 12-24 months
- **Your prime is sending compliance letters** --> Treat this as an active requirement even without 7021 in your specific contract
- **No DoD work or CUI** --> CMMC rollout does not affect you

### PALT Analysis -- NAVAIR Acquisition Forecast

**PALT (Procurement Administrative Lead Time)** is an official DoD metric measuring the window from contract solicitation to contract award. Congress and DoD mandate tracking of PALT because they want this window to be as small as possible -- which works against contractors who need time to achieve CMMC certification before award.

In December 2025, NAVAIR published its Long Range Acquisition Forecast (LRAF) listing 1,676 contract opportunities ($700K to multi-billion). Of these, **1,070 opportunities** list both an estimated solicitation date and contract award date, enabling PALT calculation.

**NAVAIR PALT by Contract Value (Unclassified Opportunities):**

| Contract Value | Opportunities | Average PALT (Quarters) | Average PALT (Months) |
|---|---|---|---|
| All values (classified + unclassified) | 1,070 | 3.34 | ~10 |
| All unclassified | 550 | 3.1 | ~9 |
| Under $2M | 294 | 2.7 | ~8 |
| $2M -- $7.5M | 86 | 3.3 | ~9 |
| $7.5M -- $50M | 92 | 3.34 | ~9 |
| $50M -- $100M | 23 | 3.4 | ~9.5 |
| $100M -- $250M | 15 | 5.1 | ~15 |
| $250M -- $1B | 11 | 3.8 | ~11.5 |
| Over $1B | 7 | 5.1 | ~15 |

**Key takeaways from PALT analysis:**
- The **$100M -- $250M** range is the first category with a comfortable window (15 months) -- and it drops back down for $250M -- $1B contracts
- **35% of all opportunities** have an award window of **6 months or less**
- **30% of NAVAIR solicitations** are anticipated in Q2 2026
- **32% of NAVAIR contract awards** are anticipated in Q2 2026
- **Smaller contracts = less time**, which disproportionately hurts small businesses
- The counting methodology was generous (best-case scenario): solicitations assumed at start of quarter, awards assumed at end of quarter, quarters counted inclusively
- Internal procurement timelines (budget approvals, vendor selection, kickoffs) consume approximately one quarter of the PALT window before work even begins

**Subcontractor pressure compounds the problem.** Primes are requiring certification evidence to even view classified solicitations. Subcontractors may have no visibility into the PALT window and face additional time pressure as primes compress their own procurement timelines.

PALT is described as "the single most useful metric for strategically planning for CMMC" because contractors can look up their specific contracts in the LRAF and calculate exactly how much time they will have between solicitation and award.

### Phase 1 Discretion Analysis -- 32 CFR 170.3(E)

A detailed analysis of 32 CFR 170.3 paragraph E reveals that the Phase 1 rollout does **not** explicitly prohibit Level 2 certification assessments. The policy language contains two critical undefined terms -- "discretion" and "applicable" -- that leave the door open for certification requirements during Phase 1.

**The regulatory text (32 CFR 170.3(E)):**
- States DoD "intends to include" Level 1 and Level 2 **self-assessment** requirements during Phase 1
- But adds: "DoD may at its discretion include the requirement for CMMC status of Level 2 C3PAO [certification] in place of Level 2 self-assessments for **applicable** DoD solicitations and contracts"
- Neither "discretion" nor "applicable" are defined in the rule text

**January 2025 DoD Memo -- Implementing the CMMC Program:**
- Directs program managers to follow the phased implementation in 32 CFR 170.3(E)
- **Attachment 1** defines which CUI categories trigger Level 2 certification as the **minimum** assessment requirement:
  - **CTI** -- Controlled Technical Information
  - **DCISI** -- DoD Critical Infrastructure Security Information
  - **NNPI** -- Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information
  - **PSI** -- Privileged Safety Information
  - **UCNID** -- Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information related to Defense
- Does **not** contain any prohibition on requiring Level 2 certification during Phase 1

**July 2025 DoD Memo -- Resources for Implementing the CMMC Program:**
- Restates the same guidance: follow 32 CFR 170.3(E) for the phased timeline
- Includes a call-out: "In some procurements, DoD may implement CMMC requirements in advance of the planned phase"
- Cautions that implementing higher-level requirements ahead of schedule "may reduce the pool of qualified contractors" -- but does not prohibit it

**Key policy observations:**
- The 32 CFR preamble states: "During the first phase, a **majority** of CMMC requirements will be for self-assessment" -- "majority" does not mean "all"
- Program managers have the discretion to determine the applicable CMMC level
- DoD will **monitor** program managers' exercise of discretion -- which implies discretion will be exercised, not that it is prohibited
- No public policy document contains a moratorium on Level 2 certification assessments during Phase 1
- 32 CFR (the rule) takes precedence over memos, and every memo points back to 32 CFR 170.3(E)

**Anecdotal evidence:** Some requiring activities have stated they **will** require Level 2 certification across the board during Phase 1 for sensitive programs (e.g., satellite components). An estimated 50-60% of all DIB data likely falls into the CTI category.

**Prime contractor dimension:** Nothing in 32 CFR or the memos restricts what primes can require of subcontractors. Primes can independently require certification regardless of the DoD phase.

**Contract option years** represent a frequently overlooked trigger -- existing contracts with option years exercised after 48 CFR goes into effect may require CMMC certification, and contractors cannot control the timing the way they can with new solicitations.

### Phased Rollout Clarification -- November 2026 Is NOT a Universal Deadline

November 2026 marks the **end of Phase 1 and the start of Phase 2** -- it is not a deadline by which all companies must have Level 2 certification. Key clarifications:

- **Level 2 certification requirements have been possible since November 10, 2025** -- there is no policy preventing DoD from requiring Level 2 certification during Phase 1
- November 2026 will likely see a "drastic increase" in Level 2 certification requirements as requiring activities who opted for self-assessment during Phase 1 begin mandating certification
- **PALT metrics are far more useful** than the phased rollout timeline for planning -- look at the specific solicitation and award dates for your target opportunities in Long Range Acquisition Forecasts
- For subcontractors: if you know what work your prime is doing, you can look up their contract timelines to determine your actual deadline -- your prime's award date might be next month or 2028

**Construction primes are a specific problem area** -- many primes in the construction space have not been communicating CMMC requirements to their supply chain because they are not compliant themselves yet. Once they achieve compliance, they will begin communicating and expecting compliance from subcontractors "pretty quickly" -- creating a compressed timeline for the supply chain.

## Open Questions / Debates

- **How aggressively will DoD components apply requirements?** Summit 7 says it will be "highly situational and sporadic" -- some strict, some lenient. The policy guidance will deteriorate as it flows to individual components and PMs. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], November 2025)*
- **Will Level 3 appear in Phase 1?** Summit 7's Jason predicts yes, driven by Golden Dome memo and political climate. DIBCAC is already running Level 3 pilots and accepting scheduling requests. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], November 2025)*
- **Will Phase 1 discretion be exercised broadly or narrowly?** The undefined terms "discretion" and "applicable" in 32 CFR 170.3(E) leave the scope of Phase 1 certification requirements as an open question. The January 2025 memo identifies five CUI categories (CTI, DCISI, NNPI, PSI, UCNID) as triggers, but program manager behavior is expected to vary. *(Source: [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]], September 2025)*
- **How will PALT windows affect small businesses?** With 35% of NAVAIR opportunities having a 6-month or shorter award window, and sub-$2M contracts averaging only 8 months, small businesses face the tightest timelines and the least resources to meet them. *(Source: [[No CMMC, No Contract - Why You're Already Too Late for NAVAIR]], February 2026)*
