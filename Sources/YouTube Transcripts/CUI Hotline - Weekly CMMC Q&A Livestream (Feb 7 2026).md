## Key Topics Covered

- **DFARS 7019/7020 Eliminated via Class Deviation** - Effective Feb 1, 2026, class deviations removed DFARS 7019 and 7020. DFARS 7020 renamed to DFARS 252.240-7997. Basic self-assessments removed; only DIBCAC medium and high assessments remain under DoD Assessment Methodology. Biggest change to defense cybersecurity clauses outside CMMC in six years. Driven by upstream FAR overhaul, not arbitrary.
- **CMMC Program Unchanged (32 CFR 170)** - Title 48 FAR/DFARS changes have no effect on Title 32 CMMC rules. DFARS 7021/7025 unchanged. Level 2 self-assessments and C3PAO assessments still go into SPRS. Annual affirmations still required. Only the duplicative 7019/7020 basic self-assessment path was removed.
- **New Minimum SPRS Score is 88** - Under CMMC (DFARS 7021), there's no concept of just "having a score" anymore. You either pass (conditional at 88+ or final at 110) or you don't have CMMC Level 2 status at all. No more negative scores counting.
- **Existing Contracts with 7019/7020** - Class deviations don't retroactively change existing contract terms. You may still need to comply with 7019/7020 if they're in your current contract. New solicitations after Feb 1 will use the new numbering (7997). Expect a transition period with mixed clause references.
- **Acquisitions & CMMC Complications** - Acquiring a company with CMMC L2 doesn't transfer the certification. When legal entity dissolves, cage code dissolves, CMMC UID and certification dissolve with it. Only C3PAOs can reassociate certifications. Acquisitions will be much more expensive due to reassessment costs. Sell before buyers figure this out if exit is your strategy.
- **Verifying Business Partner L2 Certificates** - No public database exists to verify CMMC L2 status. People send screenshots (easily faked). Some verify through C3PAOs directly. Conditional status (88/110) is harder to validate. SPRS should add FedRAMP moderate checkbox since orgs attest to 110 but use non-compliant cloud providers.
- **Vetting CMMC Service Providers/MSPs** - Ask for evidence, SOPs, policies supporting their functions. Check their FedRAMP moderate tech stack. Look for past performance, number of certified clients, % of portfolio in defense. At MSP conference, zero MSPs raised hands when asked if they had clients who achieved L2 through their services. Switching MSPs likely triggers significant change (3-year lock-in).
- **NIST 800-171 Rev 2 Still Applies** - FAR overhaul class deviations did NOT change DFARS 7012 or rescind the May 2024 class deviation pinning requirements to Rev 2. Defense contractors still implement Rev 2. GSA contractors follow different rules (Rev 3).
- **Enclaves: Fastest but Most Expensive Long-Term** - Enclaves are fastest path to compliance but cost more long-term. Scaling an undersized enclave triggers significant change and reassessment costs. Scope appropriately upfront or margins erode post-award.
- **Level 1 Then Level 2 Pitfall** - If doing L1 first on Microsoft Commercial, entire tech stack must be refactored for L2 (FedRAMP requirement). Start on FedRAMP moderate cloud even for L1 if L2 is planned.
- **CrowdStrike as SPA for CMMC** - Key questions: Is CrowdStrike uploading/sampling CUI data to cloud? Is data ITAR? Commercial CrowdStrike may work if cloud upload is disabled, but assess if capability reduction is acceptable risk. Gov platform needed for ITAR data (US person support).
- **Microsoft G5 Licensing Not Required** - Can achieve CMMC L2 without G5 Security/Compliance add-ons by using third-party tools, but it'll cost more and require more expertise. For small enclaves, all-in Microsoft makes most sense.
- **State CMMC Assistance Programs** - Connecticut: Cybersecurity Adoption Program (CCAT) covers 50% of costs up to $35K, $10K for formal assessment. Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Texas, Florida beginning similar programs. Oklahoma shot theirs down.
- **No Guardrails on Level 3 Requirements** - Nothing prevents program managers or primes from requiring Level 3. Phase 1 rollout doesn't mention L3, but that soft guardrail expires Nov 2026. Expect more L3 requirements than originally estimated.
- **Sole Supplier CMMC Leverage** - If you're the only source, you can negotiate. But most subs won't actually play hardball with their primes. Lidos sent bulletin: "certified by October or off the list." Primes forcing adoption faster than DoD.
- **Primes Driving CMMC Adoption** - Primes are issuing compliance deadlines faster than DoD enforcement. "Get right or get left" mentality accelerating. More hardline stances expected as October/November 2026 approaches.

## Transcript

[music] All right, everybody. It is Friday. Daniel is in a freshly painted office uh inhaling VOFC's. So, if he's a little loopy today, uh that is the reason why. >> Yes, it is. >> It's hotline time. So everybody grab a bucket of paint and get ready to take some deep whiffs because we got all kinds of crazy stuff to talk about this week. >> Crazy stuff going on. >> We're streaming on YouTube and on LinkedIn, so you can leave questions and comments in the chat. You can find us at cuihotline.org. Leave us a voicemail over there. You can fill out the form. You can do all kinds of stuff. We have a ton of stuff in the queue that I'm sure we won't get to all of it. If we don't get it to your question, then we'll add it to the queue like always and we'll go from there. Uh, not much to talk about today. Nope. Nope. Nothing nothing much going on out there this week. I I was laughing because it was always like people people, you know, a couple months ago were like, "When CMMC Final Rule comes out, there'll be nothing left to talk about." Okay. [laughter] >> Yeah. >> I wish. >> Not so much. Not so much. >> I wish. All right. But first, we'll start out like we always do with our week in review. Daniel, uh, I feel like we talk to companies like this every >> Uh, And the acquisition issue is a real issue for a lot of these guys. What is going on? So, I had the privilege of talking to a company this week and long story short, large international company in logistics and they had acquired an organization and that organization did not necessarily disclose that oh yeah, we have a lot of defense significant defense work and we're going to need CMMC and we haven't really done anything about it yet. So this company acquired them without appropriate cyber due diligence I'll say and now it's a like full throttle race to what is C all the way from what is CUI how do we pull out of enterprise systems that we've already started to integrate with this organization that are non-fed ramp like now we're just again they're like what do we do right and it's like I showed them a cute little picture of an enclave right so it's like a virtual desktop and like and they're like no no no I don't think you understand like we're talking scope we're not talking like two offices in scope we're talking 50 offices in scope right we're talking significant reach right so when we're talking that scale usually people are we call it like a technical divevesture basically we're having to divest their tech stack and either duplicate resources duplicate platforms with some certain non NCUI talk back to other enterprise applications. Long story short, very very complex. But the problem is you can't really do it fast. And so that's really the tension here is oh my gosh, we have to have something because we're afraid afraid our prime who's a significant part of this acquisition's revenue is going to show up any day and say CMMC or you're out, right? Um, now the other side of that coin is like, hey, we want to actually use as a marketing strategy to get more defense work. I love that approach, but like if you want to focus on not losing yours, you have to have plans and strategies and and in a ginormous enterprise ship, like the num the amount of red tape to get to an answer to even begin a design conversation could be weeks out. >> Right. And so we're they're just start they're just starting this journey which again this is not me saying oh my gosh the people I talked to are terrible people. No they were fantastic people. Love talking to them. They were just handed something because somebody further up the chain didn't do appropriate due diligence and now they're just left having to figure it out. And the problem is they're leading the integration portion into this acquisition and this red flag just got raised all of a sudden and now it's going to have to redo their whole strategy when it comes to uh integration and implementation through this acquisition, right? And so long story short like this kind of goes back to the tales oldest time like you have to do the appropriate level of due diligence. You need to have a general strategy for when you plan to execute CMMC. another call I had this week, they were like, "Yeah, I think we might use Prevail, right? Instead of like your guys' solution." I was like, "Okay, like that's fine." But like they said it in the sense like that was the only solution they had to use, right? It's like, "Oh, we're just going to plug in prevail." And we and this is the crazy part. We just need to get there enough to win the work. Right now, Jacob, this was before your podcast reveal of boom goes 7019, right? where you know that's now going to be eradicated and so really now the new minimum SPRS score because now there will be a minimum is going to be 88 right when CMMC clauses are on contract so there's this really interesting tension here of like do the bare minimum but in reality they can't really do that anymore in this kind of new world order as of this week right so anyways long story short everybody has problems everybody needs solutions everyone needs them yesterday. The problem is you're not going to really get all of those at the same time. Like you, no one can move fast without you having to get through red tape. You can't get through red tape without knowing what you're doing. So there's so many different levels to have to figure out. So yeah, start CMMC yesterday if you're in that situation if at all possible.

Anyways, talking about boom goes 7019 and 7020, man. Man, talk about we've got, you know, in the past we've come across some scoops before because we were like hyperfocused on this one space. This was an actual no one is talking about this until we put the podcast out. And understandably so because this was buried so far down the weeds that I had to like for a while triple quadruple check to make sure that I wasn't misleading myself being like this is real right because you know if you Google it can't find it if you find the regular class deviations can't find it. You have to find the special RFO deviations no one's really talking about it. Blah blah blah. Anyways we did the podcast on Thursday. Everybody go check that out if you want to know what's going on in detail. Uh the short story is class deviations were went into effect on February 1st. DAR 719 and 7020 no longer exists. Uh the DR720 was renamed to DARS 2522 2407997. So it has a new numbering and basic assessments were removed from the clause. There are now only Dibcac medium and Dibc high assessments under the DoD assessment methodology. So needing to do a self assessment and upload your score into SPSS pursuant to 719 and 7020 is now no longer a thing. That being said, like you pointed out, Daniel, all contracts since November 10th of 2025 should have DARS 7025 and 7021 in them that says you need CMMC level one, level two, self, level 2C3 PAO, and so on. So if they were to put out that you have CUI and you need a CMC level two self assessment, it would be redundant to also make you do a self assessment under 7019 and 7020. So they got rid of it. Rare W for the uh DoD folks removing redundancy. So that's great. But like you said, in the past under 719 and 7020, you just had to have a score. You didn't have to have a passing score. There was no concept of passing, right? We saw over time primes would reach out to people and say you need to have at least uh a 10 or an 88 or a 100 or whatever arbitrary number the primes came up with. But that was not actually an official DoD policy, right? Under CMC under 721 and those self assessments at level two, if you don't hit the right score, then you don't pass, right? So you can have a conditional self-assessment if you have some open POM items. You can have a final self assessment if you've met everything. If you don't fall into either of those two buckets, you don't have a status. There is no we have a negative 50 or we have a negative 100. You don't have CMMC level two. So I'm not sure how long it'll take SPRS to be updated because in the past people had to go into the one tab versus the other tab, the CMMC side versus the DODAM side, so on and so forth. But this is a big deal. This is a big deal.

D4719 no longer around. I have contracts with 719 in them. Does that mean I no longer have to meet those requirements or I can just go put a an empty space in my SPS entry field? >> Uh well, no, because it's the terms of your existing contract. So, because things changed in the future doesn't mean that the existing contract would change. This reminds me a lot. There's like all kinds of contracts on the federal side where they're still on 853 Rev3 or 853 Rev 4, 853 Rev 5 is out. But unless that contract that you're currently on is modded in some degree, that's the agreement. Right? Now, if you are in solicitation phase, right, pre-award phase, that's a different question because you got to read what's in your contract. But that class deviation went into effect on the 1 of February. So, most people are not going to see 7997 in their current paperwork. You're going to see it moving forward. Um, so yeah, I wouldn't disregard things that are already in uh your contracts and things like that, especially because we know how this system works. It's not perfect. There's lag in the system. I'm sure there are people who are going to see 7019 and 7020, especially from the primes down uh after February 1st for a while.

We acquired a company that already has a compliant tenant configured and has an L2. We can just use their infrastructure moving forward, right? The L2 covers us since we bought them. >> Incorrect. So, kind of. And this is where it gets fun and tricky. You are a organization on the left hand side. You have cage codes. Now here's the thing. Your acquisition that you just got when they come under your legal entity. Now they're going to be generated a new cage code. Right now they're going to potentially have the existing legal entity for a while potentially. But the minute that they dissolve that, they dissolve the cage code associated with their CMMC UID and their certification that went with it. The assessors, the C3PAOs have to go into EMAs and recertify or basically reassociate the certification to the boundary whenever a new cage code is added. That's how the backend works, right? You can't do that through acquisitions. Only C3PAOs can do that. If you just acquired a company and they are maintaining their legal entity and their cage code structure and their CMMC UID and the enclave itself, then yes, they can continue to use that environment. But they are now an external service provider to you ideally. The boundary that was certified is not tied to your assets. So unless those assets that you have in your entity come into control of the assets underneath their certification without causing a significant change, no, you can't use their boundary. Acquisitions are going to be one of the most convoluted things to time and plan because of the cost that you'll have to go through to reassess.

How can customers pressure test whether CMMC providers are truly staying aligned with DoD changes and evolving requirements? >> Shared responsibility is the biggest thing, specifically evidence. I've run into a lot of MSPs that have a very soft SRM or CRM. However, when you actually ask for them to produce evidence, SOPs, policies and procedures supporting those functions that they're doing, they actually can't do it. The other piece is understanding the tech stack they're using for FedRAMP moderate, for CUI handling. Our team just went to Right of Boom, the MSP conference, in Vegas and Scott had a standing audience for three hours talking about CMMC and the questions we got out of them were, kind of a pun, level one questions. Their whole tech stack has to be rebuilt or partially rebuilt to support their client base. Number of certs, past performance, number of active clients, what portion of defense clients make up their portfolio. Unless it's probably 25, 30, 40%, it doesn't make enough sense to continue to pursue this market as an MSP. Scott asked the standing room only of people who run MSPs, how many of you have clients in the DIB who will need CMMC? Everyone raised their hand. "How many of you have clients that actually have achieved level two using your services?" And no one raised their hand.

We're actually doing a webinar here in the next couple of weeks about crafting a CMMC RFP for your organization, what questions you should ask, how you should validate those things. Here's the gotcha. You're basically stuck with them for the duration of your certification. I don't see a world in significant change language where ripping out an MSP and MSSP out of your environment and replacing with another is not a significant change. You're with them for at least the duration. That's three years.

How do we verify that our business partners have their level two certificate? Do we just take their word for it? >> Man, I really wish they had some sort of database with unique numbers. Most people are just sending screenshots of their certification. The problem is those can be photoshopped. There's no validating authority right now. Some people go as far as you have to send me the name of your C3PAO and I have to validate with them that yes, you actually did get certified. The scoring of 88 is a real issue. No one is scoring it correctly. They're either putting 88 because it's the minimum or they're using the DoD assessment methodology template which has not been updated with the conditional status.

If you're making changes to SPRS, please add a "I'm using FedRAMP moderate or equivalent cloud providers for controlled unclassified information" checkbox. I have heard people fully attesting to meeting all 110 but in non-compliance with CMMC because of the cloud provider requirement and SPRS does not reflect that.

Regarding those changes, what is replacing basic self assessment? DIBCAC medium and high only. There is no basic self assessment outside of CMMC anymore. DAR 7997 now says DIBCAC can show up and assess you via medium or high assessment anytime they want to. You don't do a basic self assessment underneath 7019 and 7020. If you have CMMC level one via DFARS 7021, if you have CMMC level two self assessment via DFARS 7021, then you do those assessments and you upload them to SPRS like normal. There just isn't a duplicative requirement under a different DFARS clause the way that there was in the past.

Do the changes to 719 and 7020 mean that CMMC level 2 self assessment is going away? No. CMMC is completely unchanged. The CMMC program is at 32 CFR 170. Any changes to Title 48 the FAR the DFARS have no effect on Title 32. DFARS 252.204-7021 and 7025 are unchanged. 252.204-7012 and 7008 totally unchanged. You still do self assessments at level two if that's what's required. You still do C3PAO assessments at level two if that's what's required. You still do annual affirmations. Your self-assessments still go into SPRS.

If a sole supplier deep down in the supply chain who needs to handle CUI makes the strategic decision to not invest in CMMC compliance, how do you think the prime contractor will handle this issue? >> You're sole supplier. You have negotiating leverage because you're the only place that they can go to to get the work. Then negotiate. That's never going to be the policy that the Pentagon is going to put out. But if you're doing business, you're doing business. Lidos had sent a bulletin out to one of these suppliers and said, "Hey, if you're not certified by October, we're taking you off our list." We always knew the primes would force adoption of CMMC way faster than the DoD and that's what's happened.

Are there any guardrails to keep contracting officers from requiring level three just to CYA? No. The program manager who tells the contracting officer what level is required would end up making that decision. There's nothing that prevents them from doing that. There's also no guardrails preventing primes from saying that we need people to be level three for this work. There's going to be more level three out there than what the DoD certainly estimated. Golden Dome, NextG Encryptors, 10% construction projects, 10% of DA service contracts. The only soft guardrail is about to expire, and that's the phased rollout obligation. Phase one says level two certification at DoD discretion. It doesn't call out level three in year one. The clock until November 10th of 2026, that's probably about as long as you have before you start seeing it on contracts.

Do the new RFO class deviations override the 7012 class deviation? Do we need to implement the most current version of SP 800-171 now? No. The FAR overhaul class deviations don't change anything about DFARS 7012. They also do not rescind the 2024 class deviation. You still do 171 Rev 2 until further notice if you're a defense contractor. If you're a GSA contractor, that's a whole other can of worms because they said Rev 3.

Can I achieve CMMC level two without G5 security and G5 compliance add-ons? >> Can you get compliant? You can get compliant without those tools, but you can't get compliant without some of the functionality of those tools. You have to look at other places. It's so difficult to find partners and external tools that meet the requirements of CMMC. So many people for a cost-saving measure for a single pane of glass will end up going G5 security or G5 compliance. But you can use a spam filter from another provider, an EDR tool from another provider. You'll probably get charged more overall. For a small enclave or small business, going all in Microsoft makes most sense.

Is an enclave the fastest way to compliance? >> Yes. However, in the long term, it typically costs more. When you win a contract and your CMMC UID and your certification is tied together, if my enclave is five computers and five people and one secured room and I need to dramatically increase that scope, the cost of significant change was probably not part of the scope. It is the fastest to implement. If cost savings is the priority, you're probably going to be a little bit slower on the implementation, but you're going to save more money long term. Scope appropriately upfront or margins erode post-award.

State CMMC assistance: Connecticut operates the Cybersecurity Adoption Program administered by CCAT, funded by Department of Economic Community Development. 50% of project costs up to $35K. $10K for a formal CMMC assessment. States beginning similar programs: Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Texas, Florida.

CrowdStrike as SPA: The two problems are (1) is CrowdStrike uploading or sampling CUI data in their cloud, and (2) is the data ITAR? They would only commit to US person support on their gov platform for ITAR data. You can disable the upload of data into the cloud. The question is does it limit the capability of the product to function? You could use commercial versions of products as security protection assets as long as they're not processing, storing, or transmitting CUI. EDR tools with cloud sandboxing and sampling need careful evaluation. It depends on how you're leveraging and the acceptable level of risk.
