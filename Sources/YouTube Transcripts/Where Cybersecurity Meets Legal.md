Hello everybody and welcome back to that
CMC show. Today we have a longtime
friend, Michael McLaclin, legal lawyer
extraordinaire when it comes to cyber
security and compliance. He's got so
many fun stories to share and just an
incredible life experience. Just got
promoted. Congratulations, by the way,
on that. But, uh, I won't I'm not going
to steal all your thunder. I'm going to,
uh, go ahead and ceue it over to you.
So, Michael, tell the crew a little bit
about yourself. I appreciate that. So,
uh, my name is Mike McGlaclin. I am the
co-lead of the cyber security and data
privacy practice group at the law firm
of Buchanan and your Solen Rooney. And
as Daniel just said, I was recently
promoted shareholder. I'm excited about
uh I assist clients in a whole array of
things dealing with cyber security, data
privacy, of course, uh, artificial
intelligence and government contracting.
Uh, and so I my foray into government
contracting started actually many many
years ago. I did about 15 years in the
Navy as a counter intelligence officer.
Uh six of which I was senior counter
intelligence adviser for US cyber
command and worked really really closely
with a lot of government contractors uh
as well as federal agencies in dealing
with threats from China from Russia uh
and North Korea, Iran and then non-state
actors, ransomware groups and others. Uh
so I really cut my teeth on the cyber
security side working for the government
and now I assist clients doing the same
thing.
>> That's awesome. And what's so
interesting about it is that you know so
much. You actually wrote a book that I
read. I don't read a ton of books, but I
read Battlefield Cyber that you wrote
and it is a modernday wakeup call for
people not taking cyber security
seriously. Like the example you gave in
there about somebody 10 layers deep in
the supply chain compromising one core
component and then a missile potentially
unable to fire, right? I mean, you start
going through these narratives here. So
I if you have a few moments maybe share
a little bit about your book and then
tell us some maybe some more modern
stories about what you're seeing kind of
out there in the space.
>> Yeah, absolutely. Uh and so the book
itself was very much a labor of love. Uh
when I was getting out of active duty, I
was seeing very clearly that there were
a lot of people in the private sector
that didn't view cyber security, cyber
operations in the same way as we did in
the military. In the military, we viewed
it as a standalone domain in the same
way as air, land, and sea are a domain
of warfare. In the private sector, it
was really something that had been
relegated just to the IT personnel as
opposed to being a primary focus of
business concern and really the way it
should be and it was not being invested
in properly. Uh it to me that was really
a direct result of of executives and
people just generally not understanding
the overall battle space and really
getting so focused on the trees that
they miss the forest around them and
really miss the geopolitical drivers of
what are cyber operations, what is cyber
security, how is it something that is
occurring in China, occurring in Russia
and is directly impacting our national
security even in companies or
universities that that may not realize
And so the book itself was drawing on my
experience within cyber command uh as
well as my my experience as a counter
intelligence officer and taking that
mindset uh working really closely with
my co-author Bill Holstein who's a
fantastic journalist and has been
covering Chinese and the rise of China
for for decades. Uh we combined to to
put forth this book that really
discussed these are the threats in a way
that we thought was going to be
palatable for executives and for
everyday Americans. And we started with
the idea that the definition of cyber
warfare was just wholly inadequate. And
as an attorney, I love my words. I love
my definitions and I fall back on
semantics. But it's important. And if we
look at the traditional definitions of
cyber warfare, they generally deal with
nation states attacking other nation
states and their government assets or
potentially their critical
infrastructure. But the way in which our
adversaries wage cyber warfare, it's not
in the same way as we can we wage
kinetic warfare. And if we're waiting
for that, if we're waiting for the
equivalent of a missile strike from
Russia to occur in cyerspace or a
missile strike from China to take out
our entire electric grid, we're going to
be waiting for a very long time because
that's simply not how they do it. Our
adversaries are using cyber operations
in cyerspace more broadly to undermine
our political system to steal
intellectual property to advance their
capabilities to make us question the
things that we are doing or to to divide
us. That's how they wage cyber warfare.
And it's more like death by a thousand
cuts than it is a Pearl Harbor or a 9/11
event. And so the point behind the book
was to really detail what is cyber
warfare? What is the full spectrum of
it? Well, it's everything from, yes,
what you would expect to be a
traditional kinetic strike or a a lights
out event in downtown Manhattan, but
it's also things like intellectual
property theft and stealing from the
defense innovation base or the defense
industrial base. Um, it's things like
ransomware and it's leveraging criminal
groups as proxies to destabilize us. Uh,
it's things like corporate espionage and
stealing intellectual property through
insiders or malicious insiders. Uh, it's
utilizing North Korean IT workers and
having them fake being just regular IT
workers from the US and infiltrating
Fortune 500 companies. Um, all of these
different aspects while we look at them
as individual maybe criminal activity or
um either criminal activity or or
otherwise, our adversaries look at this
as just another cog in their machine or
or along that spectrum of warfare. and
our executives, our private sector
really needs to prepare itself because
US Cybercom is not going to be swooping
in with a SWAT team. Neither is the FBI.
And if again, if you're waiting for that
to happen, you're going to be waiting
for a very long time. Companies,
universities, they need to be preparing
themselves for a full onslaught by
nation state adversaries.
>> Man, that is a pill to swallow. But
you're not wrong. We see it in our space
all the time. people will come to us
after the fact, right, of like, hey, you
know, like we had kind of cyber
security, but then North Korea or China
or Iran deployed a ransomware and now
they took, you know, information that
the defense industrial base really wants
to keep, you know, private, we'll say,
controlled and classified information.
They're like, what do we do? you know,
which is why you see CMMC becoming such
a big deal as one of the US's like
firmst stance on cyber security
regulations is like, hey, like, no, you
really really have to do this because we
really need to protect that data. So, on
your side, I'm curious, Michael, have
you seen any like more practical like
frontline examples that you've seen in
the work you've done over the years?
>> I've I've seen innumerable. Um, and
ultimately I think I just want to clear
something up because a lot of people
come to me and and when we talk about
CMMC, a lot of people say, "Well, it's
not going to stop China." I mean, if
China wants to get in your network,
they're going to get in your network.
They are a nation state with unlimited
resources. They've got incredible cyber
actors, really, really great folks who
are going to be operating uh developing
software, developing exploits. And while
all that's true, if you're targeted by
China or really any nation state, there
is very little you can do because you
are limited your resources as a company
or as an organization, you're going
against a nation state that is designed
to do this. That's not what CMMC is for.
CMMC is more of a rising tide lifts all
ships mentality where we can't just do
nothing and so we have to have a
baseline. And when people argue it's
like well suppliance is not security. I
I would disagree. compliance is
absolutely security because if you're
not complying with a specific framework,
you are inherently going to be insecure
and that's essentially what what CMMC
is. So I don't want to throw the baby
out with the bathwater. It's not a
panacea of security, but it's certainly
better than doing nothing. And I at this
point we are we're in this space where
CMMC is is going to increase security
broadly. And that's something that
defense industrial-based companies
really need to embrace and really need
to get on board with because their
industry is one that supports national
security.
>> You're not supporting, you know, a
library down the street. You're
developing innovations to advance our
warf fighting capabilities. We should
want to secure those against our
adversaries. So, off my soap box, um,
some of the things,
>> can I add a little bit of color to that?
Here's another reason. We have people
coming into our door that say we we're
protecting our security. I was like,
"Oh, fantastic." I was like, "How are
you doing it?" It's like, "We're locking
our server in the attic." That's a real
story. And it's like, to your point,
like compliance doesn't always equal
security, but you have to have a
standard playbook that that people can
adopt or else people end up doing
nothing and and it becomes very
problematic. So, I also have a soap box
for that. Jacob Horn has the biggest
soap box of anyone I know. But back back
to you and kind of some stories from the
front there.
>> Yeah. And so, some of the things that
we're seeing are are non-traditional,
right? And so as we get through I mean
CMMC in reality it goes all the way back
to what EO13566
the this is what CUI is and then the
implementation of NIST 800171 the DFAR
7012 clause the GAO report that said
this is wholly insufficient because
everybody's lying about their
addestation
>> and then finally we have CMMC as a
result kind of a knee-jerk reaction to
failure on the part of the DIB to
actually secure these covered defense
networks. Well, what we're starting to
see is though as people implement these
things and they go through all of the
various controls and multiffactor
authentication is the easiest one we can
point to because credentials are by and
large the easiest way for bad actors or
threat actors as we call them for threat
actors to get into an environment and
it's simply you're reusing passwords. it
gets hit. You get hit on a another
breach totally unrelated and that email
address and that password are then
connected and used to access another
network. And we see it time and time
again. And all you have to do if you
have multiffactor authentication in
place that takes out that entire threat
stream. Now that's not going to prevent
like you know spear fishing. It's not
going to prevent somebody doing a
man-in-the-middle attack or SIM swapping
or anything else, but at the very least,
you're stopping that front end. And I I
mean, I'm going to throw a percentage
out there. 90% of attacks, I think,
truly do come from simple credentials
and stolen credentials or leak
credentials. So, if you can take away
that vector, that's huge in just
securing our defense supply chain. And
so we see that all the time, but now
we're also seeing other things come into
play and and things that may not
actually be covered by CMMC quite
frankly and things that we we need to be
taking taking a look at. Um DPRK, right?
So the IT workers that we are starting
to see that are masquerading as US
persons and trying to apply for jobs
with doctor resumes, fake LinkedIn
accounts, they get on video with deep
fakes or they have somebody else get on
video on their behalf with a fake ID.
They gain access to these systems with
as super users. They'll get CISA admin
credentials and it's not until you see
that they've turned off the EDR on their
devices or their devices are pinging
from an IP address somewhere they
shouldn't be that you're actually
starting to pay attention to this. Well,
it shouldn't get to the point that
you're seeing an IP address ping from
the wrong place or you get notification
that your EDR has been turned off on
this new employees device. HR should be
involved in the process, but a lot of
cases HR is a third party that's
outsourced to help with recruiting. How
many SISOs, how many executives are
actually involved in the process of
vetting that HR company from a security
perspective? Thinking to themselves, are
we going to be giving access to North
Koreans by using this HR company? None
of that's really covered by CMMC. And so
CMMC when we say it's a baseline, it's
absolutely a baseline for compliance for
a specific purpose. We really needed to
be looking at cyber security from a
holistic perspective. And that's not
even getting into like the harvest now
uh harvest now decrypt later issues that
we get to we talk about quantum or the
threats from AI that we're starting to
see come on more and more by threat
actors. Just simple things that we need
to take a more holistic look at cyber
security, but CMT is absolutely that
baseline,
>> man. All right.
It's crazy to see CMMC is now old in the
sense of protecting its modern attacks,
right? In a lot of ways, it's like it's
still something good to build off of,
but a lot of people are like, "Ah, it's
not enough." It's like, you're right,
it's not enough. You have to do more and
it expands outside of just IT
environments to your point, right? HR is
a big piece of it, right? Operational
security, manufacturing and OT, cyber,
like that's a place where it had doesn't
really have a lot of domain, right? And
so you start looking at the critical
infrastructure and everything and it
becomes problematic. But the thing to
get someone to do something I found out
over all of these years DAR 712 it
didn't do it right. No one actually
implemented the controls of NIST 800 171
because no one else did it and the DoD
didn't really care in the sense of they
didn't check the math. Right? SPRS
scores. I've known organizations that
have won contracts with negative 203,
which is the lowest you can go. And if
the DoD really cared, they would have
kind of stepped this up until CMMC was
live. Um, but now it is. November 10th
of last year, we've started the phase
roll out. Um, but question over to you
on a couple fronts, Michael, is from a
if people aren't doing the right thing
but being forced to do something, which
is really what a lot of people are in,
what organizational risks should they be
aware of when it comes to CMMC or better
yet maybe legacy DAR 712 and false
claims acts like any kind of insight on
that side?
>> Yeah, I mean that that's a very loaded
question so we'll try to unpack that
piece by piece. Um, first and foremost,
when you say the things that people
should be aware of with CMMC, it's I
mean, for a government contractor,
that's a law of the land. Now, if you're
if you have a if you operate a covered
defense system, if you're handling CUI,
you have to be in compliance. Understand
what the CMMC level that you are at, and
it's either going to be level one,
you're just dealing with contract
information, or it's level two, and
you're actually dealing with CUI. If
you're in level three, you know you're
in level three because the type of data
that you're handling is so sensitive
that the government's coming in saying,
"We are going to go in to do the
addestation. We're not even going to
leave it to a C3PA."
>> But it's the point that we can't and I
think companies, especially DID
companies, are coming to this
realization that burying your head in
the sand is just not a solution. So now
we get to the challenge of a bottleneck,
right? because there are only I think
about a hundred and I could be wrong
about that number but about a hundred
C3PAOs that have actually been certified
for
>> somewhere in that ballpark but for
300,000 DB companies that need certified
by 2028
>> the numbers there just don't add up like
we are going to have a significant
problem so those companies that have
been waiting and waiting to get in
compliance and to get certified they're
going to run into a real issue and so
then it's going to be well how do we
ensure that we're we are still achieving
the same innovation. We're still
attracting the same good small
businesses that should be involved in
the DIB and make sure that they're also
compliant from cyber security
perspective. Ultimately, the answer
there is going to be managed service
providers because companies themselves
are not going to be able to do it and
we need to have managed service
providers that are already certified
that are able to just move the ball
forward and basically you get a check in
the box because you're using a certified
managed service provider versus one
that's not. Um, and the challenge you
run into there, and I'm gonna get on my
soap box again. The challenge you run
into there is Dan, if you and I wanted
to go out and start an MSP today, we
could we could go hang out our shingle
and we could be Mike and Daniel's MSP.
>> That's right.
>> And that would be that. And we could go
offer services and no one would be able
to tell the difference between you and
me or a very high-end MSP that's
extremely expensive, but very efficient,
very good at what they do because
there's no certification process,
>> right? There's no underwriters
laboratory that's putting their stamp of
approval on an MSP as to whether or not
they are certified. There's no American
Bar Association saying you are a
certified MSP. So really, you know,
Billy the IT guy from down the street is
just as good as you Microsoft in the
eyes of any sort of certifying authority
because it just doesn't exist. So that's
that's a problem. Being able to vet MSPs
that are going to be able to do this on
the one hand is important, but also
those that are going to be able to get
you CMMC certified because if you are
just starting right now, you are way
behind the eight-ball and realistically
in order to be in compliance by 2028
with the number of C3PAOs we have right
now is going to be pretty tough, if not
impossible.
>> So that's kind of the tricky part. So
the DoD and 32 CFR said, "Hey, we're
going to revise this a little bit. We
think 118,000 companies have to be
certified for level two. It's like,
okay, let's take that number back. 100
or so C3PO.
>> So big bottleneck problem. Or so we
thought. So when this started happening,
and this is the interesting part, it's a
bottleneck, but in a place that people
don't assume. And it's to your second
point. C3PAOs are continuing to suspend
assessments because of they couldn't
provide the SSP. Well, that's kind of
step one of the actual assessment. We're
seeing the bottleneck actually happen
with the managed service providers being
able to onboard people in a compliance
state before their certification. And so
what's crazy about that is like so
there's that bottleneck, but then
ultimately there's also going to be the
C3POS that they have to schedule, right?
Because those are schedules months out
in a lot of cases. Sometimes you'll get
like a you know out of the blue moon
you'll get like a random assessment date
become available if you're ready. But
like those are being scheduled multim
months out. But a lot of people think,
"Oh, I can just go this is a real
story." Uh, somebody delivered a 20
slide PowerPoint deck and said, "This is
my SSP to an assessor,
right?" So like the and then they're
having to be said, "No, that's actually
not, and you need to actually go find
help." Oh, well, help's four months
away, three months away from you getting
to help, and then I have to come back in
line to get certified. So again to your
point there's multiple bottlenecks here
and I think a lot of people are
overlooking the complexity of CMMC
audits versus like ISO or other
frameworks in general.
>> Well and all the while you've got the
business and the operational side of the
house trying to live through the valley
of death especially for small businesses
that are just starting to do business
with the federal government. If you can
survive that valley of death, good on
you. But now you're having to fight a
battle on multiple fronts where you're
also trying to get in compliance with
CMMC. Address this bottleneck. And then
let's say for the sake of argument, you
win the contract, but you were
unsuccessful in the CMMC certification.
Now your contract is subject to a
protest. Because if I'm competing
against you, if I'm representing a
company that competed against you and I
didn't get the contract and I get wind
that you're not CMMC certified, the
first thing I'm doing is going to the
GAO and filing a protest immediately.
>> I It's It's funny. I was talking with
somebody the other day. They're like,
"How would you actually do that?" I kind
of sat back and I'm like, "How would I
find out?" It's like, "Oh, the easiest
way to find out is to look up their DNS
records and see if they're still pointed
to non-fed clouds, right?" And then you
have an idea of, okay, they would
potentially be in a non-compliant
environment because emails typically in
scope and then I can go protest. Um, and
it's like it only takes a little bit of
information that's publicly available to
potentially protest for you self
attesting to a perfect 110 CMMC L2 score
only in reality is like you're not
actually meeting the full requirements,
right? Um, becomes very very
problematic. Well, hey Michael, this has
been fantastic. I always love to leave
the guests with one last thing and
that's closing remarks. Any bits of
wisdom, your favorite food, best
restaurants, whatever your closing
remark wants to be. Um, the floor is
yours, my friend.
>> Yeah. So, I'm going to try to be a
little bit philosophical here. My
closing remarks. So, my favorite color
is red. Uh, and favorite restaurant. I
love ethnic food. There is a little
place on 9inth Street that has in DC
that has the best Ethiopian restaurant
right by the convention center.
>> Fantastic. Um, called Family Ethiopian
in case you're wondering.
>> There it Anyway, um what I'm going to
leave you guys with is when we are
talking about CMMC and and this is the
part that really it always kind of
shapes me a little bit when we have
government contractors that are
complaining about CMMC and I understand
that that challenge. What you have to
understand though is when you get into
the defense industrial base, you're
essentially in a walled garden. You have
unlimited opportunity to do business
with essentially do business with an
organization with what will soon be a $
1.5 trillion budget. That is an
incredible opportunity for any
contractor.
That aside, when you're dealing with the
federal government, particularly with
the Department of War, your business is
national security. You should be
focusing on delivering capabilities,
delivering tools to war fighters so that
they can have an edge against our
adversaries or at the very least so that
that tool, that capability, that
equipment functions as it's supposed to
function when they're in a firefight.
And if that's not the mindset of defense
contractors, you should not be in the
defense industrial base. CMMC plays a
critical role in that process in
ensuring that we are delivering
capabilities that have the lethality
that we want that are defensible to our
war fighters. That's the mindset we need
to have.
>> Man, what a closing remark. And you're
not wrong. I How many defense
contractors have integrity and mission
and all of that in their in their
mantra, right? In their in their mission
statement. It's like, hey, this applies
to all aspects, right? this is how you
run your organization from a cyber
perspective all the way to the materials
and equipment that you're delivering to
the war fighter, right? And we need to
make sure that that stream continues
from the back office all the way through
to the front lines, right? And so, man,
what incredible closing remarks,
Michael. Thank you so much for your
time. Um hopefully we'll have you back
here again to maybe review your second
book, Battlefield Cyber 2: The
Reckoning, right? I'm just throwing out
some names for you. You don't have to
take any of them, but um but I really do
appreciate your time. I'll know where to
send the royalty checks though. Don't
worry, Daniel.
>> There you go. That's what I'm talking
about me.
>> Absolutely. Thanks for watching
everybody and uh stay tuned for the next
one. [music]
