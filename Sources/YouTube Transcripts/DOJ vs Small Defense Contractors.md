## Transcript

All right folks, it is April of 2025 and boy do we have a doozy for you today. So you may remember we predicted that in 2024 a small defense contractor would get caught up in a False Claims Act settlement, and we were only off apparently by a couple of months.

So we've had several episodes about the False Claims Act and the Department of Justice's Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative. We've seen settlements with large defense contractors, we've seen settlements with major research universities, and now we finally have what it looks like when a whistleblower case against a small defense contractor goes all the way to settlement -- $4.6 million plus interest.

This is worth paying attention to because it could be anybody listening to this podcast. There are tens of thousands, if not more, of companies doing DoD contracting work in the exact situation outlined by this settlement. Not because of a breach, not because they were working some super cool high-speed system or data or anything like that -- just standard everyday violations of the exact same cybersecurity requirements pursuant to the exact same DFARS contract clauses that every defense contractor handling CUI has had in their contracts for years. And that's what we're going to talk about today.

They say that usually things don't resonate with you -- like the repercussions of your actions don't resonate with you -- until something bad happens to somebody like you, right? And so this was one of those things that we thought needed to happen for people to take it seriously. Even when we talked with professionals about FCA cases and things like that, the cases that were public since FCA kind of became a talking point weren't things that a whole lot of organizations in the DIB could point out and be like, "Hey, that kind of looks like me," right? And now we get a case of that -- an FCA claim against an organization that resembles almost 75% of the predicted DIB base that's going to need CMMC certification. Absolutely.

So let's -- instead of just reading the settlement at people or reading the press releases, we went through -- we're going to talk about this in our favorite thing ever, over the course of a timeline, to sort of help you understand the story of how you go from minding your own business doing your thing to writing a check for four and a half million bucks.

**The Timeline**

**2016:** The DoD's cybersecurity contract clause DFARS 252.204-7012 is revised and updated to say you must implement NIST SP 800-171 requirements. If you put our data in the cloud, it has to be FedRAMP Moderate or equivalent, blah blah blah -- all the stuff we've talked about a million times. They also create a provision that goes into solicitations, DFARS 252.204-7008, to make you aware that you are agreeing to comply with this clause that's going to go into your contracts. It's been that way ever since.

Then a bunch of bad stuff happens, and in **2020** the DoD comes out with a DFARS rule that creates CMMC 1.0. But it also does some other stuff -- it also created DFARS 252.204-7019 and 7020. This was the other half of the rule, and this is the one that says you need to conduct a self-assessment, you need to calculate a score according to this crazy math system that they came up with, and you need to upload that score into the Supplier Performance Risk System, or SPRS. So there were two parts of this rule in 2020.

In **March of 2021**, the DoD pauses the CMMC program for their strategic review of the program, right? And it isn't until November of 2021 at the end of the year when they say, "We're going to do 2.0, we're going to go through rulemaking." And then we go through that whole saga that we've been documenting on this podcast for a couple years now that we're just getting to the end of. But in the meantime, DFARS 252.204-7019 and 7020 remained in effect -- they're still in effect right now. Just because CMMC was put on pause, the other part of the rule has been in contracts since 2020.

So the DoD is off doing the CMMC 2.0 rulemaking thing. Meanwhile, in **October 2021**, the DOJ -- the Department of Justice -- announces the Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative. So this is separate from what DoD is doing. And in their press release for this initiative they say: "The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative will utilize the False Claims Act to pursue cybersecurity-related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients. The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative will hold accountable entities or individuals that put U.S. information or systems at risk by knowingly providing deficient cybersecurity products or services, knowingly misrepresenting their cybersecurity practices or protocols, knowingly violating obligations to monitor and report cyber incidents and breaches."

**A Quick Primer on the False Claims Act**

The False Claims Act is the government's primary civil tool to redress false claims for federal funds and property involving government programs and operations. We've done two episodes with two experts on the False Claims Act before -- we'll link them below so check those out.

The False Claims Act includes a whistleblower provision which allows private parties to assist the government in identifying and pursuing fraudulent conduct, to share in the recovery of any money in terms of fines and restitution, and protects whistleblowers who bring these violations and failures from retaliation.

Under the FCA, individuals or entities who knowingly submit false claims to the government are liable for what is known as treble damages -- meaning three times the amount of the damages the government sustains -- plus civil penalties. The per-claim civil penalties currently are between $12,500 and $25,000, and those adjust for inflation over time. So they go up over time, per violation, which is how you get into violations in the millions whenever the per-claim violations are like $10,000 to $20,000.

**Back to the Timeline**

So in **October of 2021** they're announcing this initiative. If you go back to **January of 2021**, the contractor -- the company in question -- hires a head of security. So they've got a security team, they've got a head of security, they've got about 150 employees, they have contracts with the Air Force and the Army. They have the same contract clauses as everybody else -- DFARS 7008, 7012, 7019, 7020. During that same time period they submit a self-assessment score of 104 to SPRS. The maximum score is 110, so it's a nice score.

One of the things is that every professional that we've spoken to about the FCA said that plausible deniability technically isn't an excuse, right? And so when you input your score in SPRS, then you're knowingly submitting that score. Realistically, "knowingly" does not mean that -- it means you could know what was going on. "Knowingly" is a specific term. So check out the episode with Alex Karis and Stephanie Sigman that we did -- we go all into "knowingly." But you know, if you're listening to this, you know, right? If you are capable of listening to this podcast, you knowingly know what's going on.

So this all happens in January. CMMC gets put on pause in March. DOJ announces their separate program in October. They have a 104 in SPRS. About half a year later, in the **summer of 2022**, a third-party consultant tells this contracting company that your actual score is negative 142. It's not a 104 -- it's a negative 142.

And here's the trick: **they do not update their SPRS score in the system.** They know what their real score is. They know their score is false. They do not update the score.

This is speculation at this point because we don't have statements from the whistleblower or anything like that -- maybe there will be in the future -- this is just what we were able to piece together based off of what we know of who was involved. I would imagine that at this point the whistleblower is really stressing out because about the same time they get hired is about the same time this false score gets submitted. They're probably telling people inside the company, "We need to get this fixed." They hire a third party, they find out it's a disaster, and they're not getting the score updated. There's probably a lot of fights and tension and pushback going on inside the company.

Because in **January of 2023**, the head of security leaves. They lawyer up. They file a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company violated the False Claims Act by failing to comply with cybersecurity requirements in its DoD contracts. Check this out -- less than 60 days later, the company is served with a DOJ subpoena concerning their cybersecurity practices. Literally 50 days after the whistleblower complaint, DOJ's knocking on the door being like, "We want to see what's going on in here."

So then in **June of 2023**, three months after the DOJ subpoena, they update their SPRS score to say they have a 57. And then later on in October they updated to 82. And then in the **spring of 2024** they have a perfect 110.

So we've uploaded a score of 104, we find out that we're 200 points in the wrong direction, we get subpoenaed, and then we start to gradually rebuild this score over time. So when you look at that you're like, "Okay, well, they submitted the wrong score, they found out they were doing it incorrectly, and then they slowly updated their score back to a perfect score, so now they're good, right?" Like they repaired their score over time.

Well, apparently not. Because in **March of 2025**, after two years of a DOJ investigation, the president of the company signs a settlement agreeing to pay $4.6 million to resolve the alleged violations that occurred between 2018 and 2023. So even though they've fixed the problem in 2024 and they now have a perfect score, you're paying $4.5 million for the false claims you made before that happened. So your perfect score doesn't mean anything because you got paid on contracts when you allegedly weren't compliant, right?

So this settlement says they're resolving allegations that they submitted false or fraudulent claims for payments on contracts with Departments of the Army and the Air Force, and that those claims were false or fraudulent because the company knew it had not complied with those contracts' cybersecurity requirements.

**So just because you're good now doesn't mean that you were good then, and there's proof that you knew you weren't good then, and you got paid. So now it's time to pay up.**

So check this out -- the $4.6 million: you got to pay a million dollars to the government no later than 14 days after the effective date of the settlement. There's no payment plan -- a million dollar check. You got to pay $3.6 million to the government 60 days from the effective date of the settlement. And the whistleblower got 18.5% of each of those payments, totaling $851,000.

Now I don't know about people listening here, I don't know how many heads of security you guys know -- I don't know any head of security that makes $851,000 in a year or several years. They got paid big time for a thing that I am confident -- looking at the timeline -- they probably begged and pleaded this company to do for two years. Yeah, just based off of the timeline.

**The Math**

Now let's talk about the numbers. We often have conversations that say implementation costs for CMMC are in the six figures. So let's just assign the lowest possible six-figure number to that cost, which would be $100,000. Let's say that -- would you rather pay $4.6 million within the course of 60 days from the effective date of your settlement, or would you have liked to have 46 years' worth of implementation costs?

I mean you got a six-figure cost to implement and comply, you got a seven-figure fine if you don't, right? And the seven-figure fine is due over a more immediate timeframe. This is 60-day escrow, bro.

And this is a 150-person company. So you know, the thing is -- if everybody remembers -- the Verizon False Claims settlement with the GSA back in 2023, Verizon paid $4.1 million. This company paid $4.6 million. The fines do not scale based on company size. They're based on contract value, the number of violations, and that's set in the statute. And the only difference is that the larger companies that get that same penalty actually can kind of absorb it a little bit better -- they don't even blink.

99% of the companies that we talk to, if you told them they had to write a check for a million dollars in two weeks, otherwise, that's it -- they're going out of business.

Would you like to spend 7% of your annual budget on security, or 670% of your annual budget on a penalty for not doing the security? Insane.

**Whistleblower Outcomes**

Now quick note -- there were some people when we were talking about this on LinkedIn, they were like, "Well, you know, the whistleblowers got to pay legal fees and they take a big hit and blah blah blah." I'll just tell you, in my experience I've talked to the Georgia Tech whistleblower, I've talked to the AirJet/Rocketdyne whistleblower, I've even talked to the whistleblower involved in this case very recently. All of them have jobs after they blew the whistle. All of them got paid somewhere between $800,000 and a couple million bucks. So that's just a couple of anecdotes, but they're doing just fine.

And as part of the settlement, the company had to pay $198,000 to the whistleblower's lawyers -- outside of the restitution that they had to pay elsewhere. So I don't think that the whistleblower had to pay their lawyers; I think that it was part of the settlement that they had to pay the whistleblower's lawyers. $198,000 of that $4.6 million. But even if they did pay $200,000, they're still walking away with $650,000 anyways, telling the truth.

**What They Admitted To**

So a lot of times in these settlements they're like, "We're agreeing to settle, but we don't agree to any fault, right? We're not claiming that we're at fault for anything, but we're going to write a big check." Because that's why you settle -- so that all the really really bad stuff doesn't get out there.

Here, they say: as part of the settlement, the company admitted, acknowledged, and accepted the responsibility for the following facts:

1. Between January of 2018 and 2022, they used a third-party company to host emails without requiring and ensuring that the third party met the requirements in FedRAMP Moderate baseline or equivalent, and complied with DoD requirements for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, etc. -- all the stuff in DFARS 252.204-7012 paragraphs C through G. That is exactly the same language as C through G.

2. They also had to admit that the contracts required them to implement all the controls in SP 800-171, but from 2018 to 2023 they had not fully implemented those controls, and if they weren't going to implement those controls, it could have significant risk of exploitation and exfiltration of controlled defense information. All that stuff that's contained in DFARS 252.204-7012 paragraph B -- that's exactly the language out of paragraph B.

3. They also had to admit that from 2018 to 2021, despite the contract system security plan requirement, they had no consolidated written plan for each of their covered information systems describing boundaries, environments of operation, how the requirements are implemented -- whatsoever. And if you pay attention to your clauses in 7019 and 7020, you can't calculate a score without an SSP. So you can't upload a score if you don't have an SSP.

4. Finally, they admit, "Yeah, we had a score of 104, we were told that the score was 200 points in the other direction, we never updated it, and we didn't update it until after we were served a subpoena."

When you're going through some of the things that they admitted to and some of the things that are behind it -- how many conversations do you and I have, separately, together, with other people in the ecosystem, where they are getting pushback from a cloud service provider to give them evidence in support of these exact clauses? It happens all the time.

Literally, like we said, the things that they admitted to as a part of the settlement is every company. Like, every company has this problem. I mean, this is your average everyday Joe, right? Like this is the average everyday Joe getting in trouble. It is everyone in the DIB. The fact that it happened to this company is besides the point -- like we're not here to drag this company in particular. You can figure out who it was if you're really curious. We're talking about this because this is you. This is you right now. If you read what this is, there's a very good chance that you fit into this exact box, and this box will cost you $4.5 million. And the only thing keeping that from happening is someone inside of your company not calling this law firm right now. That's it.

**Government Quotes**

U.S. Attorney Leia Foley from the District of Massachusetts: "We will continue to hold contractors to their commitments to follow cybersecurity standards to ensure that federal agencies and taxpayers get what they paid for, and make sure that contractors who follow the rules are not at a competitive disadvantage."

Special Agent in Charge Keith Kelly of the Department of Army Criminal Investigation Division Fraud Field Office: "We are committed to protecting the warfighter and maintaining the Army's operational readiness while holding those who engage in such acts accountable."

Special Agent in Charge William Richards of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations: "We alongside our investigative partners and the Department of Justice will continue to combat fraud affecting the Department of the Air Force and hold those accountable that fail to properly safeguard sensitive defense information."

Special Agent in Charge Patrick Hegerty of the DCIS Northeast Field Office: "Failing to comply with DoD contract specifications and cybersecurity requirements puts DoD information and programs at risk. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to investigate allegations of false claims on DoD contracts."

**100 Pending Cases**

We have heard through the grapevine that there are a hundred of these cases pending in the DOJ system. The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative -- hopefully we can get away with saying this -- is a Biden-era program that is now still being upheld through the next administration. The next administration is focused on fraud. They seem very clear-eyed in their quotes about what's going on.

This is as cut and dry as you can get. It's 100% alignment too -- it's not like, "Oh this one's taking it seriously and this one's not." Every single one of them is like, "We are coming after you." It's like Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, right? "Tell them hell's coming with me." That's the way it is, dude.

This is not getting enough attention. I mean we're talking about it on the podcast. It is not getting enough attention. When the news that the DOJ was going after universities broke a couple months ago, it was like one of the only LinkedIn posts I've ever had that was 100,000 views. This one did like 10. It is not getting enough attention.

If you're listening to this, if you're a company president, if you're a head of security -- this is the one. This is the big one. This is a dot on the timeline of the saga of DoD cybersecurity requirements, compliance, CMMC, DOJ, all that stuff. This is a major, major event in the story of how all this stuff plays out. This is everybody.
