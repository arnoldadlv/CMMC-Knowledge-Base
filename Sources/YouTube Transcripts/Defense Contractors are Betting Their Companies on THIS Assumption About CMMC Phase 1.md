[Music]
Alrighty folks, it is September of 2025
and we are currently on rulemaking watch
pending the publication of the 48 CFR
CMMC final rule. The reason that's
important is that when that rule goes
into effect, it will start the CMMC
phased roll out. DoD is going to put
CMMC certification and assessment
requirements into contract in phases of
12 months at a time until they're in all
contracts and solicitations. And the big
question is, will there be level two
certification assessments or not in the
first 12 months, phase one of this
phased roll out? A lot of people have
heard or have convinced themselves that
they will not be asked to do anything
other than a level two self assessment
for those first 12 months. We are going
to go through the three pieces of policy
that explain what the phase roll out
will look like and you can decide for
yourself because that's not how I read
the policy and I would feel very guilty
if I led someone to a conclusion and
they ended up holding the bag if you
will and needing to get a level two
certification assessment. So, we'll walk
through it. We'll read it together. You
can go read it on your own and then you
can make up your mind about whether you
think level two certification
assessments will happen in phase one or
not. Daniel, you hear this all the time.
I mean, you hear this all the time. All
the time this morning, so just for
reference, talking to a large defense
manufacturer and I'm on the phone with
them or talking about building out a
solution with them and they're like, you
know, but do we really need this? I
mean, we can kind of like selfattest
for like the first year. And I just want
to make be very clear when people say
self test I think it's the same
requirements as SPRS and just put a
score in.
>> It's like different rules of engagement
here like either perfect score. We've
even talked about I think there's even
conditional capabilities even on your s
you know your updated SPRS score but
like you can't just put like a 50 and
still win contracts in a selfestmc
world. So, if you just put that on the
shelf for a second, and we're going to
talk about it a lot today, but there's a
very strong case to be made to say that
the word discretion that pops up a lot
in these documents we're about to look
over, uh, we think the DoD has actually
defined that internally and people's
behavior is typically to lean more
restrictive. Little CYA coverage here.
And um yeah, but I talk to people every
day, Jacob, that and you're on these
calls like every day they're saying,
"Oh, I can just self test for the first
year. I can just self test." Like I
don't actually have to really like be
done with CMMC is kind of more of the
vibe that I get. And it's just like no,
you kind of have to be done with CMMC
and you actually might have to certify.
So let's jump in it. I'm I'm curious to
see where this journey takes us, my
friend.
>> Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. So,
we're going to talk about the relevant
portions from three pieces of policy.
We're going to talk about 32 CFR 170,
the program rule that went into effect
at the end of 2024. We're going to talk
about clarifying guidance in a DoD memo
that was released in January of 2025.
And then we're going to talk about yet
another clarifying DoD memo that
clarifies that guidance that came out in
July of 2025. So December policy,
January memo, July memo, and now we're
here in September of 2025 and everybody
has decided that there will only be self
assessments in the first 12 months. So
let's dive into it and uh and then you
can decide whether you want to take that
bet or not. Okay. So rewind December of
2024, December 16th of 2024, the CMMC
program rule officially went into
effect. And the relevant portion of that
rule is title 32 uh or or yeah so title
32 in the CMC program rule. So we're
talking uh section 1703
paragraph E. So that's the part of the
rule that we're talking about. It's
called applicability. And in 1703
paragraph E it says DoD is utilizing a
phased approach for the inclusion of the
CMMC program requirements in
solicitations and contracts otherwise
known as the phased roll out.
Implementation of the CMMC program
requirements will occur over four
phases. Here we're very focused on the
first phase, the first 12 months. They
say that phase one begins on the
effective date of the complimentary 48
CFR CMMC acquisition final rule. That's
what we're currently waiting on now in
September of 2025, the final rule to get
published and go into effect and trigger
the start of phase 1, just like we knew
would happen back in December. They go
on to say DoD intends to include the
requirement for CMMC statuses of level
one self- assessment or level two self-
assessment for all applicable DoD
solicitations and contracts as a
condition of contract award. Wonderful
for those contracts where that is the
applicable requirement level one which
are self assessments level two self
assessments. There you go. But they go
on to say DoD may at its discretion
include the requirement for CMMC status
of level 2 C3PAO an external third-party
certification of your CMMC level two
status in place of level two self
assessments for applicable DoD
solicitations and contracts. This is the
first big question mark. One, what does
discretion mean and how much do they
have and when will they use it and why?
What does that mean? We keyed in on this
on our 32 CFR final rule webinar in
January before this memo came out. We
were like, alert, alert, alert. What
does that mean? They're giving them the
opening to exercise their discretion for
applicable DoD solicitations and
contracts. What does applicable mean?
how do we know what it's going to apply
to or not? At the time when this rule
came out, we didn't have clarifying
guidance. So, they were big question
marks. They go on to describe phase two
one calendar year after the effective
date. And they say that's going to begin
phase two. And in addition to these
phase one requirements, the DoD intends
to include the requirements for level
two certifications for applicable DoD
condition of award. So 12 months after
the 48 CFR final rule comes out, there
will be level two certification
assessments. That's not up for debate.
But that first 12 months, will there or
will there not be uh level two
certification assessments? Based off
just the text of 32 CFR 170.3 paragraph
E, there is no policy guidance that says
there will only be self assessments.
It's very important to remember before
we start talking about the memo. Does
that make sense? Am I am I taking crazy
pills?
>> It makes sense because if it's one of
those things where like the DoD needs an
out. I mean, think Golden Dome, right?
It's like there are going to be very
sensitive projects out there that are
going to have to require more stringent
requirements due to the nature of the
work and the DoD wants to be able to
elevate it to a certification status
early.
>> Yeah,
>> I get that. The biggest problem I have,
I know we'll get into this later on, is
number one, they don't actually define
what discretion is in here. Again, even
that they leave at discretion, right?
Um, but they also don't even say who can
make the call,
>> right? Like they're not saying that, oh,
you know, has to come from the secretary
of defense or the CIO's office or
they're not saying who actually gets to
make the call discretion. How far down
the ladder is it? Is it just a
contracting officer who gets to decide
that? Is it a senior official? Is it,
you know, I I mean, who is it? Who gets
to do this?
>> Now, here's the fun part. Here's the fun
part about reading the whole rule is
that buried in the public comment
responses from the DoD, we get a little
bit more information about their idea
behind the phase roll out. So, this is
the part that doesn't really get talked
about a whole lot. I've pulled a couple
lines. I've taken the liberty of taking
a couple lines from the preamble to the
rule. my favorite my favorite thing in
the world. So people are looking at this
as an in an absolute way. They're saying
there will be zero level two self
assessments, but to your point, we don't
know what discretion means. We don't
know what applicability means. At some
point in the preamble, the DoD responded
to public comments. And they said during
the first phase of the plan, a majority
of CMMC requirements will be for self
assessment. A majority, not all of them.
Now that's great because the DoD has
also said this. They said this at Seek
West uh earlier this year. They've said
this many times that they intend for
there to be a lot of level two self-
assessments. They have not said that
there will be no level two certification
assessments. So just keep that in your
back pocket, right? They're saying the
majority will be self- assessment, but
at this point it's pretty obvious
someone's getting a level two
certification assessment, which is why
I'm really harping on this point because
if you're listening to this podcast and
I tell you everyone's getting a self
assessment and then you get a
solicitation that says you need a
certification, then it's my fault for
misleading you and I want to be able to
sleep at night.
>> So, let's look at some more of their
comment responses. They say, "Program
managers." Okay, so now we know the
program managers will have discretion to
include CMMC status requirements or rely
on existing def clause 7012 requirements
in accordance with DoD policy. Okay, so
the PMS get to decide. We still don't
know how they're going to decide or why,
but we know who is going to decide. And
they go on to say the DoD will monitor
the program manager's exercise of
discretion to ensure a smooth phase in
period. This is where you should ask
yourself why would they need to monitor
their exercise of discretion if the
policy clearly said that there will be
no certification requirements, right?
Like why would you need to monitor
something that can't happen? Clearly it
can happen. Clearly there is discretion.
Clearly there's going to be some reason
why they would or wouldn't decide to
include a level two self or
certification assessment. But as of
right now, this part of the 32 CFR 170
CMMC program policy does not explicitly
prohibit level two certification
assessments in the first 12 months.
That's going to be very important as we
start to talk about the memos. So the
question to ask yourself at this point
based off just what's in the rule, if
you're going to be working under this
mysterious applicab applicability, if
you're going to be working on an
applicable contract, will your DoD
customer exercise its discretion or not?
We don't we don't know. We don't know.
>> We don't know.
>> Let's add just a little bit of color to
this.
>> Sure.
>> Because we've talked about it a lot.
What's written here also does not
dictate what your prime can require from
you as a sub.
>> Correct?
>> So, we're talking about what the CMMC 32
CFR states as requirements issued to the
prime which will then end up flowing
down to subs. That's what we're talking
about here. So, just I want people to in
their mind go ahead and divorce. Like if
you're a sub working with a prime, they
can require CMMC of you whenever now
that certifications are allowed, right?
>> This is specifically highlighting the
prime to DoD relationship a contract
award. And again, that will end up
flowing downstream. But to your point,
Jacob, I'm looking at this text. I don't
see anywhere where people can pull out I
can only I only had to self for year
one.
>> You might you might be able to self
assess, but you also might not be able
to self assess. It does not clearly say
one way or the other. And so if you're
going to make a bet that you're not
going to get a certification
requirement, you're taking a big risk
because you could be wrong. There's no
extra information. But let's see what
the memo from January says. Maybe it'll
help clarify because that's its whole
point. So shortly after this rule goes
into effect, January rolls along. Happy
New Year. And we get a DoD memo. This is
a memo to senior Pentagon leadership,
the defense agencies, and all DoD field
activity directors broadcast out to all
the decision makers. The subject of the
memo, implementing the CMMC program,
guidance for determining appropriate
CMMC assessment levels and the process
for waving CMMC assessment requirements.
We did a whole episode on this back in
January. This memo is only like seven
pages long. Most of that is fluff at the
beginning and nothing at the end. And
it's it's really a quick read. We're
going to link to it. It's on DoD
procurement toolbox. You should read it
because there's not a lot of information
in the 32 CFR. So maybe this will tell
us. So this memo talks about the
importance of cyber security and what
DR712 does and the relationship to CMMC
and yada yada yada. Then they go on and
they say, "Upon publication of the title
48 CFR def rule, the thing we're
currently waiting on, program managers
and requiring activities shall include
the need for CMMC assessments in
procurement uh request and requirement
documents in accordance with the phasein
timelines described in title 32 of CFR
section 170.3." That's what we just
read. Y
>> makes total sense. They're saying the
guidance for the phase in period is what
we just talked about. Yeah. They say
attachment one to this memo provides
program managers and requiring
activities guidance to apply when
determining the appropriate CMMC
assessment level to include in each DoD
solicitation and contract. This is
great. This is going to tell us how to
determine applicability as a PM.
Perfect.
>> That's fantastic. They go on to say that
there can be waivers authorized by
service and component acquisition
executives. This is what we've talked
about in the past. That guidance is
contained in attachment two. We're not
talking about waiverss today. We're
talking about level determination and
applicability. And this is the line that
people are overreading in my opinion.
They say at the conclusion of the
phasein period, program managers and
requiring activities will designate a
CMMC level for each contract as
appropriate according to the attributes
of the information that will be
processed, stored or transmitted on
covered contractor information systems
as described in attachment one. Multiple
multiple multiple people have DM'd me
and I have talked to them in circles and
they said that line says at the
conclusion of the phase in period there
will be self assessments and therefore
there there will be certification
assessments and therefore there will not
be certification assessments during
phase one. I do not think that is
correct. It is true that at the end of
the phase in period there will be
requirements for level one and level two
and level three and certification and
self- assessment because it'll be fully
implemented and will be in phase 4 full
implementation forever. That does not
prohibit the inclusion of certification
assessments in phase one anywhere in
that line. And that's the thing that
I've seen people really hinging on. And
I think that as we dig further into this
memo, we'll start to see where that
falls apart.
any any thoughts so far here?
>> I'm just like looking at this and I just
keep thinking like, okay, I get that
language, right? If you read it for what
it is, out of context of the 32 CFR at
the conclusion of the phase in period,
and it's like, okay, well, there's a
four-phase period, but in that in the
four phases, there are requirements of
certification even at the level three
level at DoD discretion and then onward
after that. So it's like
>> they're not going the DoD is a little
upset at the DIB. Quite honestly, they
didn't do the DAR 712 thing. The DoD
found out in like in like 2019 they
Congress said go do the CMMC thing and
make sure it doesn't happen again. And
like so that's what 3 years end of 2017
plus we're in 2025 eight years and then
they're going to wait another four
years. We're going to wait 12 years
since the requirement was basically like
had to be done before the DoD is going
to require third party certification
that you've done it. I just in my brain
I just don't see that being the case.
>> Yeah. And again at this point we still
don't have a line that says hey PMS do
not put certification requirement for
level two during the first 12 months.
still have not seen that line to
override the open-ended policy at 32 CFR
170. But let's look at what attachment
one says because remember they said
attachment one is going to tell program
managers how to determine what's
applicable which level is applicable to
what. So what does attachment one say?
Attachment one says uh DAR's clause 7012
and FAR clause 5220421 establish the
requirements for FAR-based contracts.
Okay, we've got some basic episodes
we'll link to if that's news to you.
That's what imposes the requirements on
you. They say title 32 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, section 170.3, the
same section we've been talking about
all along, uh, describes a phased
implementation plan for the assessment
of compliance with these FAR and DARS
requirements under the CMC program. So,
hey program managers, read attachment
one. They have these existing
requirements. Section 170.3 talks to you
about the phased roll out. We've all
read 170.3 and we know it's open-ended.
They go on to say program managers and
requiring activities shall follow the
CMMC program implementation phases
defined in 32 CFR 170.3 paragraph E the
one that says you can exercise
discretion based off of applicable DoD
solicitations and contracts. They say
upon the publication of the title 48
DAR's rule, all procurement requests
that may result in a contract where the
contractor or subcontractor at any tier
may have federal contract information or
FCI uh residing or transiting through
its information system shall include
CMMC level one. Cool. That's a self
assessment level one. Easy peasy. One
year after publication of the DFR's
rule, program managers and requiring
activities shall also begin to require
CMMC level two certification assessments
when appropriate. Two years later, in
phase three, they can start to require
CMMC level three certification
requirements. DoD program managers and
requiring activities will use the
following CMMC level determination guide
to identify the appropriate CMMC level
for a given contract. So here it says
phase one, you have FCI, you're getting
level one. Phase two, you have the
appropriate data, you're getting level
two certification. Phase three, you're
the applicable type of contractor,
you're getting level three. Still
doesn't say anything about exercising
discretion and applicability in phase
one, right? Still hasn't said don't do
that. It just told us to follow the
guidance at 32 CFR 170.3.
So they say here is the data for how to
determine a a given CMMC level. CMMC
level two certification is the minimum
assessment requirement when the planned
contract will require the contractor or
subcontractors to process, store or
transmit CUI categorized under the
National Archives CUI registry defense
organizational index grouping. This is a
group of categories of CUI controlled
technical information, DoD critical
infrastructure security information,
naval nuclear propulsion information,
privileged safety information, and
unclassified controlled nuclear
information related to defense. If you
have those types of data, whether
they're given to you or whether they are
generated by you under the terms of a
contract, the applicable requirement at
a minimum for that contract is CMMC
level two certification as spelled out
in attachment one as guidance to the
program managers. And according to the
language at 32 CFR 170.3,
they have the discretion during phase 1
to include a level two certification
requirement. So now the question is,
will you be handling this type of data
during phase one? And how confident are
you that they will not exercise their
discretion to require a level two
certification for you during that first
12 months? because we have not seen
anywhere in this memo do not require
level two certification during phase
one. It's still open-ended because all
they do is point back to the 32 CFR rule
that says discretion and applicability.
And then you read the memo and they say
applicability is determined by the
nature of the data. So if you have the
data in the first 12 months, how are you
feeling lucky? Do you want to roll the
dice? If you if you don't know, you have
to understand the nature of the risk
that you're taking that you won't be
required to have a level twoert or that
you will be allowed to only selfassess.
And that's a very situational question
because different program managers,
different programs, different,
you know, components, different
requiring activities are by definition
different.
>> Yep. Anecdotally, we have heard from
some requiring activities and they said,
"No, no, no, no, no. You don't
understand. Our suppliers put hypers
sensitive capabilities on satellites.
We're going to require that they have a
level two certification assessment
across the board. Period. We're not
jacking around with self- assessments.
We already tried that and it didn't work
and we have the discretion to do it.
Now, we don't have a public source that
we can provide you for that. You're just
going to have to take our word for it at
this point. But this is really the point
is you can read this policy for
yourself. People have read it and said
assessments in phase one. That's not how
I see it, but there's still another memo
to talk about. So, maybe there's some
Easter egg in that memo that's going to
clear this all up.
I'm just telling you, Jacob, like
listen, nobody actually knows all the
types of data that's flown down, but I
just my gut says probably somewhere
around 50 to 60% of all the data
generated or in receipt of defense
contractors probably falling into the
CTI box, this control technical
information box. And so, but I'm looking
at this and I'm thinking, okay, I'm a
contracting officer or program manager
that doesn't want to lose my job because
sensitive data got leaked out because we
didn't validate certified uh primes and
then they primes it didn't validate
their subs. I might be more inclined to
slap on a certification requirement at
my discretion because the memo says this
is the most sensitive data that we have,
>> right? So, why not throw that
certification requirement on top of it?
And don't forget, most contracting
officers don't actually know what CUI or
not. They're really just looking to CYA
themselves. Yeah. So, I'm looking at
this and I'm like, I don't see a world
where number one, to your point, Jacob,
I can derive that I will never get
certified as part of phase one. Hard
stop.
>> And number two, if anything, I feel like
it's I'm becoming more inclined that I
will get a certification because they're
going to have a little cheat sheet on
their desk of certified, not certified,
right? and they're going to look and
say, "Which type of data are we doing?"
Navy. Oh, we're doing this. Okay,
perfect. Certify even during phase one.
>> Yeah. And that's the that's the question
is how confident are you based off what
it says in the policy that you can read
right now that you will be gifted 12
months of discretion to only self
assess? And that's the question that
only you can answer as the business
owner. But just realize that there is no
moratorum that we have seen described in
policy. so far. But let's look at this
most recent memo. Maybe there's some
information in there that will finally
settle the case. Uh, spoiler alert,
there isn't. So, July of 2025, another
DoD guidance memo that goes out to
senior Pentagon leadership, the heads of
the defense agencies, and the field
activity directors. The subject of this
one is resources for implementing the
CMC program. And the relevant portion of
this memo says 32 CFR 170.3 paragraph E.
What do you know? The part of the policy
rule from December that talks about the
phased roll outlines
a phased timeline for inclusion of CMMC
assessment requirements in DoD
procurements and explains that during
the first 12 months of implementation,
activities should include CMC self-
assessment requirements in applicable
solicitations and contracts. There's
that word again, the applicable
solicitations and contracts. The policy
from January says if you got contracts
and solicitations with this data, the
applicable requirement is level two
certification. If you got the other
kinds of CUI other than the defense
categories of CUI, the applicable
requirement is level two self
assessment. So that's still not an
answer. They go on to say it's important
to follow the recommended implementation
plan to ensure that industry has
reasonable time to demonstrate
compliance and become eligible for DoD
contracts. Of course, we shouldn't
require things that aren't required. I
don't think anybody would disagree with
that. Implementing higher level CMMC
assessment requirements ahead of the
phased implementation timeline may
reduce the pool of qualified contractors
able to propose on competitive
acquisitions leading to reduced
competition and potentially higher
contract prices. Yes, that is true%
>> right. And then it says attachment one
to this memo provides an overview of the
phased implementation timeline. And I am
not kidding folks. You can find this
same image at the bottom of this July
memo, which we'll link to, or on the DoD
CIO website about CMMC section right
now. It's literally smart art out of a
PowerPoint, and it says phased
implementation of CMMC requirements.
Phase one begins at the 48 CFR effective
date. Where applicable, there's that
word again.
>> Yep. Where applicable, solicitations
will require level one or level two self
assessment. And then there's a call out
bar at the bottom of the slide that says
in some procurements DUD may implement
CMMC requirements in advanced of the
planned phase. So, here we are almost a
year after 32 CFR comes out and they say
during phase 1, the first 12 months,
program managers have discretion to
include level two certification for
applicable solicitations and contracts.
And they even go on to say in that rule,
we're going to be monitoring the level
to which they exercise that discretion
so they don't screw this up and require
too much too soon. in January they
clarify and they say the only time that
the minimum requirement is level two
certification is when you handle these
types of data. It doesn't say that you
are uh prohibited from including level
two certification requirements in phase
one. It says look at the type of data
involved in the solicitation. And then
you fast forward to July and we get
another memo and it just restates the
same thing. Read 32 CFR 170.3 paragraph
E. And then it says level two self-
assessment for applicable contracts.
Level two certification assessment for
applicable contracts. Read the memo from
January to figure out what's applicable.
So here we are again. the same situation
that we were in in December is that
there is no explicit policy anywhere
that we can find publicly that says that
there will only be level two self
assessments during the first 12 months
of the phase roll out. And despite that,
we went to Gold Coast, we're on the
phone every day, we go to events all the
time, we're talking to people everywhere
all the time, as much as we can. And
there is this common sentiment that the
48 CFR rule is going to come out. It's
going to go into effect and trigger the
start of phase one and people will have
12 months to self assess before they're
required to get a level two
certification. And that is not what I am
reading in this guidance. And if I
didn't stomp my foot about this, I would
feel terrible if someone who watched
this podcast was led to conclude I get
an extra 12 months and then they end up
losing out on contracts and potentially
their business because I wasn't being
clear enough about the possibility that
you could get the level two
certification. Now, does the DoD intend
for most people to be able to self
assess? Yes. That still means that some
people are going to get a level two
certification. And if those some people
are you, you've got a problem on your
hands that you need to prepare for. So
we don't know. We don't know exactly
what phase one is going to look like.
It's going to depend on the customer.
It's going to depend on the data. It's
going to depend on a lot of variables
that you would know based off your
specific situation better than anybody
else. And that's what should inform your
understanding, your now new
understanding of the policy. Do you want
to take that risk or not? Because
business is about taking risk. So, if
you want to gamble that you're going to
be able to self assess and spend that
money on implementation somewhere else
for that first 12 months, feel free. But
it isn't because I told you the wrong
information. Does that make sense?
>> It does. I mean, again, I'm going to
zoom out for just a second. Going back
to the this is a prime DoD relationship,
>> right?
>> Okay. Let's say it is I'm going to go
crazy, Jacob. Let's say it is self test
for the first full 12 months. Sure.
>> And I haven't started anything. Like,
okay. Well, let's see. My implementers,
my consultants I was going to use,
they've got a four-month backlog. Okay.
All right. So, then I go and get the
environment built out and I'm getting
compliant. I'm writing all my compliance
documentation. That's another, you know,
three or four months. Organizational
adoption is the longest pull in the
tent, right? Okay, so let's just say I'm
eight months from like signing something
to like I've got a working environment
and I'm I'm almost through
organizational adoption. Well, then I
need to play in my C3PAO.
>> Okay. Well, there's only four months
left before it's going to be a hard
requirement for certification and
contracts. Do you think their backlog
might be a little bit busy at that
point?
>> Right.
>> Okay. Well, then how many months can I
miss out on of defense revenue at that
point? So again, best case scenario, you
can fully self attest. We cannot tell
you that you should hang your hat on
that. You need to make your own decision
based on the data in front of you. But
here's the thing. How quickly is
Lockheed going to get a copy of 48 CFR,
take a look at it, and say, do you know
how long it's going to take us to turn
our supply chain to certifications?
How many suppliers I got? 20, 30, 40,
50,000 suppliers?
>> Yeah. I mean, they're going to start day
one, right,
>> shoving this down your throat for
certification, even regardless, in my
opinion, of what the DoD does. And I do
believe the DoD is going to leverage
because they hardcoded the language in
32 CFR because Jacob, what trumps a memo
or 32 CFR?
>> 32 CFR because the memos say follow the
guidance at 32 CFR.
>> Every one of them has said follow the
>> Discretion, discretion, discretion. And
if I know people, people people are
going to want to put as much safety in
the contracts that they are overseeing.
Um, period. I mean, we see this all the
time. So, again, make a wise decision.
Weigh both what you think the DoD is
going to do, but also weigh what you
think your prime is going to do.
>> Yeah. And if you have questions about
those, please for the love of God, ask
them because this is going to impact net
new solicitations as part of a
requirement of contract award. And the
thing that a lot of people are snoozing
on contract option years post 48 CFR
going into effect.
>> Yeah, that's going to hit you way sooner
than a new solicitation that you can
somewhat control, right? On the sense of
choosing to bid on it or not. You've got
warm bodies sitting on a base somewhere
that's dependent on that work, right?
and you might not be able to win it
because of the position you put the
business in. So yeah, I there there is
it's like playing roulette. That that's
really what it comes down to. You got to
play business roulette with this. Make
an appropriate level decision of risks
that you think you can handle. But don't
come back to Jacob. Don't come back to
me and say Summit 7 said I can self
assess forever.
>> Now listen, we'd love to help you. We
don't sell assessments though. We're not
assessors. So I'm not here to convince
you that you need to schedule your
assessment with us. We just help with
the implementation and you're going to
have to implement them whether you get
the self assess or you have to certify
or not. So it's six of one and half a
dozen of the other from our perspective.
But I've just heard a lot of people say
I read this memo and it says only self
assessment in phase one and I'm like you
know I've read a lot of these things
over the last five or six years. A lot
of memos, reports, rules, comments, all
that stuff. And it's not how I'm reading
it. So maybe I'm losing a step. Maybe
I'm missing something. Let us know. Are
we missing a memo? Are we missing a page
out of our copy of the memo where it
says somewhere there will be no level
two certification assessments? Because
we will issue a correction and do
another podcast episode being like,
great news everybody. There aren't going
to be any level two certifications in
phase one. But as of right now, that's
not what the policy says. So you got to
be careful one where you're getting your
info from because that's going to
influence the decision that you make.
And if you make the wrong decision
during phase one, that could be the last
decision that you make for that company.
Uh, and we don't want to see that happen
to anybody. So, no,
>> uh, we'll link to all this guidance. You
can read it for yourself. Our DMs are
always open. We do this podcast all the
time. Tune in to the hotline on Fridays
and ask us questions about it. Uh, this
is really kind of the big thing that's
out there right now is this, you know,
will there be self assessments or not?
And so, we're going to be talking about
it a bunch in the future. If there's
another memo, like and subscribe because
we're certainly going to do an
explanation and posting about it and
chopping it up and doing all that stuff.
We're still on rule watch. I don't think
there's going to be any information in
that 48 CFR final rule that changes any
of this guidance because it just
implements the guidance from the 32 CFR
rule. So, I think that these memos are
going to be all that we get and it's
just going to be a big question mark and
then it's a question of how much risk do
you want to take and uh and then we'll
go from there. So, there you go. Those
are
>> fresh on sam.gov, right? just like we're
just going to wait and see which one.
>> Yeah, exactly. So, there you go. Those
are the three pieces of guidance. The 32
CFR rule, the January memo, the July
memo. Links are below. Give them a read.
Let us know, do you agree, disagree? Did
we read them right? Did we read them
wrong? Uh we're interested in all
people's opinions and perspectives here.
And uh and then we'll see you next week.
See y'all. Thanks everybody.
Hey,
