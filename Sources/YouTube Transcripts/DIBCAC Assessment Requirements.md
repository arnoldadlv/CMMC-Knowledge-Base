[music]
All right, everybody. It is
Thanksgiving. It is November of 2025.
So, happy turkey day to everybody. We
got a little bit of a scoop for you here
on the show this week. Since the end of
October, we have learned of at least
half a dozen defense contractors that
have received official notices from
DoD's Defense Industrial-Based Cyber
Security Assessment Center, the DICAC
team, informing them that they will be
undergoing inperson audits of their
compliance with DEFARS clause 252204712,
including their implementation of the
requirements. performance in NIST
special publication 800171.
Red alert, red flag, nightmare scenario,
not the email that anybody wants to get
right before the holidays or ever. The
problem is that every one of these
companies assumed that they would only
need to achieve CMMC level one
selfassessment status. And so while
everyone has been focused on CMMC,
DEFAR's clause 2522047020
has been in contracts since the year
2020 and it gives DoD the right to show
up at any time and audit your cyber
security compliance. So what happens
when you get the knock on your door?
What do these notices actually look
like? That's what we're going to talk
about today. This is one of those times
where it's really really important to
read the entire text message because
when you sent me a text message and said
we're doing a uh Thanksgiving Day show,
Jacob, and you said, "All I read was
scoop, assume, and knock at the door." I
thought it was the people that are about
to knock at my door. You were going to
be one of them. You were going to have a
scoop of delicious ice cream to go on
top of a piece of pie that we were going
to eat with friends and family. And now
you're telling me that Dibc might come
knocking on the door for some DIB
organizations. And that kind of blows my
mind because I heard we always had the
old adage, right, was Dipk may come
calling and they may want to see your
documentation. You know, they'll call
you on Monday and they want to see your
documentation on Friday. I I thought
that would be what people would be more
accustomed to. But now we're saying
people are thinking that they're going
to get level one self assess and dip
when we're doing a high assessment.
>> Yeah. Now, it's uh it's a whole other
conversation around how somebody would
think that they were CMMC level one if I
don't know they were receiving marked CI
and they work on critical programs and
they're the prime contractor and that
they've had these clauses in their
contracts all along. Like I said,
totally different story. No judgment.
We're going to save that for another
conversation.
>> Another conversation. Where's my scoop
of ice cream that you promised?
>> Yeah, exactly. Uh yeah, if Dipk if Dipk
shows up bringing a a gallon of ice
cream around Thanksgiving, then
Christmas will be cancelled as we'll
find out shortly because they are not
playing around and uh the clock starts
ticking the moment that you get the
official notice. So just a quick review,
we've already covered Dar 712 and 7020
and all of the other clauses in the DAR
cyber series as we call it. We'll link
to those below. If you're unfamiliar
with the text of those clauses, watch
those episodes and we step through all
of the paragraphs of those clauses, uh,
which really are, you know, the center
of gravity for the obligations imposed
on contractors. CMMC is just a
verification program for those
requirements. This is when the DoD
themselves shows up to do the audits.
There's not a lot of DIK auditors, which
is why they went to a third party system
in CMMC to try to scale that audit
capacity. But just the basics real
quick. Since 2016, if you are handling
controlled and classified information
under contract with the DoD, then the
cyber security requirements in DAR's
clause 252204712
apply to you. And since 2020, the DoD
reserves the right to show up and audit
your compliance pursuant to DFARS clause
252204720.
This is the part of the CMMC 1.0 0 rule
from 2020 that everybody forgets about.
The reason you have to conduct a self
assessment and upload a score into SPSS,
the reason why DICAT can show up and
audit you at any time uh to see if
you're actually complying with DAR 712
is because of the other half of the CMMC
rule that never got put on hold that
never went back through other
rulemaking. And so DICAC, which is part
of the Defense Contract Management
Agency, DCMA,
will send you an email informing you
that they will be at your door in 90
calendar days to assess your compliance
with DFR712. 90 calendar days, including
holidays. So, the companies that we know
of, they got these emails at the end of
October, are getting their assessments
in person with Dipk in the middle of
January, which means any prep, any
deadlines around Christmas,
Thanksgiving, New Year's, whatever
holidays you celebrate, they don't care.
You get 90 days in order to uh get ready
for uh to get ready for the show. The
email includes a pre-assessment item
document that outlines everything that
Dipk wants to see. You can find this on
the DICK website which we'll link below
if you want to go through and see the
kinds of things that they're going to
ask for. We're going to go through the
list here in just a second. And then you
have two weeks to acknowledge that you
have received this notice. So, happy
Halloween everybody. Dipac would like to
show up and verify your compliance.
Please acknowledge this email within two
weeks. We'll see you in January. Oh, by
the way, here's a massive list of all
the things that you need to provide to
us.
uh see you next year.
>> Massive list that you need to provide
within the next 90 days or within that
two week right like the email introduces
says hey it's dipk give us this list of
stuff within two weeks and then 90 days
we're coming
>> yeah so the audit in person will start
in 90 days but you have to provide these
uh these documents and artifacts ahead
of the assessment for them to prep. So,
the tenative like generic schedule
that's included on these emails says 5
weeks prior to the assessments, you're
going to have a pre-coordination phone
call with them. So, after you've
acknowledged everything and then a
little while later, they're going to
say, "Okay, let's get on the phone and
make sure we're all on the same page."
Two weeks prior to the assessment,
they're going to send you a request to
give them all of the artifacts in their
list, uh, sent over to them via DoD
Safe, which is their file transfer
setup. a week before the assessment. Uh
they're going to verify that they have
received your documents. So, uh they
want it two weeks ahead of time. They
need to uh 100% have it at least a week
before the assessment starts. They're
going to do their out brief by the end
of the assessment. Uh and then no later
than 60 days after the end of
assessment, uh they will provide the
results of their audit to you. The
assessments run Monday through Friday
for a week from 8:00 in the morning
until 4:30 in the afternoon. This will
blank out an entire week for a number of
people in your company to answer a lot
of questions. Uh, and it's not
negotiable because it's in your
contract.
>> 35 days.
30. You have essentially 35 days from
the time they email you to the time that
your pre-oordination call is supposed to
happen in order to have all of your
stuff in order, all your artifacts and
evidence delivered and everything like
that essentially, right?
>> Merry Christmas everybody.
>> Yeah. So, so at this point, right, you
have the data, you have DAR712, and you
have uploaded a score into SPSS, and
hopefully it is an accurate score
because their action item checklist
starts out with some basic things that
they want from you. The first thing that
they want you to do is to perform
another self assessment uh uh and then
upload that score into SPRS. You're
going to conduct this assessment in
accordance with the DoD assessment
methodology, the 5.3.1
point controls, so on and so forth. And
then you're going to upload that score
into SPS. Hopefully there's not a big
disparity between your two scores. And
hopefully that second score that you
upload is also accurate because they're
going to be there in a couple weeks to
doublech checkck all of your work. They
want the basic self- assessment results
provided to them, including a score for
all of the system security plans that
are relevant to all of the systems. The
date that the score of 110 is expected
to be achieved. If you have open items
on a POAM, they want you to provide them
with the system security plans and any
POAMSs for all of the systems that are
relevant to this assessment. They want
all of the cage codes that are supported
by your system security plan or plans.
And they want a description in those
SSPs of how each of the 110 security
requirements are being implemented. And
according to Dipk's own words in their
preassessment checklist, simply copying
and pasting the requirement verbiage
from NIST SP800171
would not be acceptable. And by the way,
NIST SP800171A
as an alpha is the companion publication
developed to support assessments of CUI
security requirements. As such, it is
the primary and authoritative source of
guidance for organizations conducting
such assessments. I really, really,
really hope and I know that listeners of
this podcast will not get caught in this
situation that a company is only finding
out about 8001 171A
when they get the email from Dibc and
open up their preassessment checklist.
That is a bad time to figure out that
171A exists.
>> Yeah. And I mean, that's kind of how it
was worded there, right? Like in that
quote, it's it's just worded like, "Oh,
yeah. in case you didn't know.
>> By the way,
>> yeah, that's what this is the companion
document that we're going there.
>> And you can Yeah, you can imagine that
if you had uploaded a score in SPS
without knowing what 171A is, you
magically discover what 171A is and you
run the same assessment, your scores are
going to be very different and that's
going to be a big question in uh in like
80 to 90 days.
>> So, let's just from me immediately just
hearing the basics and you go through
them and seeing them, right? Uh the one
thing that really jumps out to me is the
there's got to be some red flags that
are going to be raised for these
organizations that the week that Dipcat
comes or the week before they have to
submit this new SPS basic score, right?
It it goes from like negative to oh
we're in good shape or we're in good
shape to negative, right? like we've
heard from Dipk and Nick Del Roso in the
past where when the things come in to be
validated it's differently and even more
dis more red flags if Dipkat comes in
they say hey that score that you just
changed to that's now your most current
and accurate score with all this stuff
to reflect it uh we just went through
and evaluated and it's more like what
you had in there before.
>> Yeah.
>> Like things can get really dicey.
>> Yeah. And we also know from DODIG
reports in the past and Dipk's own
statements Dipk works very closely with
the Department of Justice. So, uh, do
not mess around with these scores. Uh,
these are these are not a joke. Uh, this
is Defense Contract Management Agency.
This isn't some random C3PAO that you
hired to verify your work. This is the
real deal. So, uh, this is not for
messing around outside of rerunning your
basic assessment, uploading your score,
making your SSP available, all those
things.
>> Now, they get into the details of what
they want to facilitate their on-site
assessment. So, they want you to provide
a detailed network topology diagram and
a network enterprise overview briefing
to include a high-level operational
concept graphic of how everything works
in your environment. They want a diagram
of the enterprise network and the
unclassified systems that have CUI
traversing them. They say that the
diagram must depict the network topology
and security posture of the enterprise
systems or enclaves that processed CUI
data. And these drawings/overview
briefings must clearly delineate the
applicable following things from this
list. Security boundaries, your cyber
security stack, security event and
information management from your seam
system, connections to other systems and
networks, your cloud connections and
your data flow, wireless systems,
dedicated point-to-point connections,
MLS clouds, high-level IP address schema
for your network, critical network
services, vulnerability scanning
methodology, authentication methodology,
your enterprise logging methodology, any
remote access that you have into these
systems, how promote users browse the
web and how you web content filter their
activity DNS, VoIP, video, any other
relevant information to allow assessors
determine if your corporation is truly
protecting CUI as a single uh or
multiple uh enclave setup. That's what
they want at the top in their briefing
for how you are doing these things. Uh
yes, question. Hm. Sounds a lot like the
initial C3PAO assessment process, right?
Going
>> very similar. Very similar. And they
want it uh right now. This isn't
dependent on, oh, we are going to
schedule it out for a little while or
what I've heard from people who deal
with DICK, they're not exactly gracious
with granting extensions. Uh their
resources and time are very limited and
they are very interested in talking to
you as soon as possible. So yeah, if
you're prepping for CMMC, then uh all of
this stuff shouldn't sound uh
unfamiliar. If you've been hoping that
CMMC wasn't a thing and you don't know
what any of this stuff is,
congratulations. None of this has
anything to do with CMMC. This is just
DoD's own thing.
>> And then as the organization technically
they're your customer and they're
evaluating your effectiveness, but when
you're the organization, you're getting
a C3PO assessment, you're kind of in the
customer relationship, right? And able
to guide some stuff. You don't have any
push here, right? There's no leverage.
>> Uh yeah, this is so you know, if you
want to sort of split hairs on the the
language that gets used, CMMC
assessments are assessments and they're
really only looking at your
implementation of NIST SPE 171. Dibc
assessments are straight up audits.
>> They work for DCMA. And that gets us to
the next section of this intake form
where they talk about flowdown. So, if
you've watched our video on DFR712,
you'll know that there are multiple
paragraphs in that clause and only one
of them says you need to implement NIST
SP800171.
The rest of the paragraphs are equally
as valid. They have other obligations
that are imposed on you like fed rant
moderate equivalency, incident
reporting, incident response, incident
handling, and flowing the clause down to
subcontractors. Your CMMC assessment
won't look at your flowown of DAR 712.
That's not included in the scope of
assessment. It is included in the scope
of assessment for Dipk. They
specifically say you need to demonstrate
how the organization management manages
contractual lower level system security
plans. Dibc will assess the
organization's ability to protect CUI at
an enterprise level to cover as many
contracts as practicable, which will
inherit NIST SP8001 171 requirements
from the enterprise. Here's the juicy
part. Since DAR's 712 requires covered
contract information systems to be
subject to the security requirements in
800171,
DICtak will need to understand how the
corporation provides governance over
this process and will use a sample of
contracts to ensure the enterprise
mechanisms, policies, procedures, and
requirements flow down to the contract
level. So you're giving us all this
information about where your CUI goes.
when that CUI goes to your
subcontractor, 7012 is supposed to go as
well. You can certainly prove to us that
you've been governing that process,
right?
>> Let's let's see. Let's let's just just
see. Let's just give it a whirl. Let's
>> Hey, you could have a perfect 110 score
and fully implement NIST SP 800 171 and
have massive violations on your Dibc
assessment because you haven't float
anything down to follow the flow of CUI
to your subcontractors. This is much
bigger than just, oh, did you turn on
MFA? Right? This is the This is the
contract management agency. They're
worried about contract flow down
>> sometimes when you tell me things are
juicy. Uh
we exaggerate a little bit. I get it.
But like when we're in the middle of a
conversation where the entire
conversation's juicy, I'm like, "How
could you make it even juicier?" I don't
know if you saw my face when I realized
exactly what you were saying. That's
wild.
>> Because now what controls a spiderweb?
It there's there's no limits that says
we'll we'll do maybe one or two
contracts. It's how far do we go down
this web if you still got
>> spinning deep
>> and now we get into those third, fourth,
fifth tier contractors that
>> okay
>> just like I hope you didn't find out
what 171A is when you got their email. I
hope the first time that you told your
suppliers that they have these
obligations was when you got the email.
So just be aware. Uh, and if you're one
of these companies, you know, God forbid
that thought you were CMC level one,
that's a really bad situation because
you just don't have time to get all this
stuff done.
>> Oh, dude, I totally that I just
completely overlooked that.
>> That was the whole premise of the show.
That was the whole premise of the show,
>> Like this is happening to people that
think that level one was the only thing
that was in the immediate future.
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> So,
>> yeah. Now, now when this was starting
out like in 2020, 2021, this was all
news to people, but at this point,
Dipk's going to say, "Hey, man, uh DR720
has been out for six years." Like, this
isn't uh this isn't news to anybody.
Well, speaking of the rest of DRA712,
not just flowdown, they also say in
addition to the NIS SP8001 171
requirements uh imposed by DR712, DICAC
will need to verify compliance with the
additional requirements of the clause
cloud computing, cyber incident
reporting, cyber incident damage
assessment activities. So you could have
a perfect 110 score having fully
implemented 800171 and have done none of
the other paragraphs in DAR 712 and have
massive problems on your hands when Dipk
shows up that you wouldn't otherwise
have in your CMMC assessment. So be
aware, watch that episode on 712. You
have more than just what's in 171.
>> Yeah, I think that that's the thing is
people even more mind-blowing here is
people are narrowly focused on their
CMMC requirements, right? when this hits
them and that CMMC focus is obviously
siloed compared to what this covers.
It's insane.
>> Yeah. So, the good news [clears throat]
is is everybody has a fully staffed,
fully funded, well-resourced,
well-trained cyber security department
inside of their company. And so, DICAC
isn't going to bother you, Mr. and Mrs.
business owner about the uh details of
your compliance with cyber security
requirements. They even give you a list
of who they would like to talk to. The
recommended subject matter experts who
can demonstrate implementation and
answer questions should be available for
interviews for each security family in
NIST SP800171
up to including your network
administrator and security engineer
employees with audit and accountability
responsibilities. Cyber security and
information technology policy oversight
team whoever is responsible for account
management personnel with information
security responsibilities in general
your system developers. Personnel with
access enforcement responsibilities,
your risk assessment team, your incident
response team, your senior information
security officer, anybody who works in
human resources that's adjacent to these
things, your physical security
specialist and or manager slashte, your
configuration management team, anybody
who runs enterprise services or leads
that team, uh your active directory
administrator if you have such a person
on your team, so on and so forth. If you
make those people available, they can
answer all the questions that Dibac has.
C certainly those people are available
because that's how you answered the
questions in accordance with NIST SP8001
171A, right?
>> Wait, so let's think about what
realistically is going to happen for 70%
of the DIB. It's going to be like, hi,
here's the company that I outsource this
to these services to my service
provider, right? And then for some of
the stuff that they don't outsource,
it's going to be the same person.
They're just going to switch like polos
like in the Old West movies with the guy
that ran like the hotel and the bar at
the same time. Two different jobs. Like
that. That's what it's like. That's
that's what the real trenches are like.
>> Yeah. That's uh most most companies do
not have these separate dedicated teams.
>> Like half of the people listening to our
show are going to be like listening to
every role that you just listed and
they're like, "Wait, that's me.
>> That's me. I do all those. I wear all
those hats." Yeah. Well, Tip Jack's
gonna want to talk to you. And so if you
have been, I don't know, working with an
outsourced managed service provider or
managed security service provider and
they haven't really been doing what
they've told you you've been doing,
that's your problem. Because if you
don't have a service level agreement
that says they're going to be sitting at
a table to answer these questions, if
they're not prepared, if they're not
ready to go in two weeks, five weeks
out, you know, one week out, and then
the actual assessment, are they going to
sit with you for 5 days Monday through
Friday from 8 to 4? Like, how much is
that going to cost? Are is that what
they've built? Do they even know what's
going on? Do they have any experience in
what's happening? Do you just have one
IT guy? Are you just finding about all
this stuff for the first time? This is
not a joke. This is the real deal. This
is completely separate from the CNNC
process. This is happening to real
companies right now. Has been happening
for a long time, but for some reason we
got notified of a flurry of these
situations. If you are out there and you
think you will be CMMC level one, double
check your math. If you think you're not
going to see a CMC level two C3PAO
assessment requirement, one, go check
sam.gov. I don't know if you've been
checking it recently, but go check that
or follow me on LinkedIn. I post about
them all the time. Like and subscribe, I
think. Uh then you need to also double
check your math because you could never
see a CMMC level 2C3PA requirement for
whatever reason. You still have
obligations under DR712 and DoD will
still show up whenever they want
pursuant to DAR 7020. And you can't say,
"Well, we thought CMMC wasn't
happening." They're going to go, "What
are you talking about? that has nothing
to do with what's in your contract.
>> Yeah. And I mean, kind of the same uh
outcome scenarios, right? Like you're
gonna lose contracts if you blow a dip
assessment, right? You're
>> nothing's going to happen. It's good for
business.
>> The boilerplate language is standard
contractual remedies will apply. You can
get uh yeah, a bunch of stuff can
happen. You can get fines, you can lose
contracts, you can get negative
performance indicators, you can get
referred to the DOJ, so on and so forth.
They're not very transparent with the
kinds of things that happen, but as you
can imagine, this is not the situation
that you want to be.
>> None of them sound good.
>> None of them are good. Nothing good will
come out of getting this email and then
discovering a new revelation every time
you read every sentence in that email
about the things that you are on the
hook for and the things that you now
need to provide quick, fast, and in a
hurry. So, uh we have heard about this
situation through the grapevine either
from the companies themselves or the
people working with them. It is a mad
scramble for them to get ready for this
assessment and there's a good chance
that it's going to cost them dearly.
It's definitely going to cost them time
and money. They are in a bad situation.
So, as we enter into the holidays, let's
all give thanks that we haven't received
these emails from Dipk and that we never
will receive these DI emails from Dipk.
But just so you know, uh they got some
stocking stuffers for you. These things
are all in contracts right now. have
been in contracts for 7020 has been in
there since 2020. 7012 has been in there
unchanged since 2016. They don't want to
hear anything about your thoughts about
CMMC, when you thought CMC was going to
happen, what level of CMMC you thought
was going to happen. Fun fact, pro tip
here at the end. Thanks for staying
until the end of the video. If you have
a CMMC level 2C3 PAO assessments, I have
heard that DICAC isn't all that
interested in what's going on because
they have some assurance that you've
been doing these things and they'll move
on to another company. So, the best way
to avoid this email from what I have
heard is to go get your CMC level 2
C3PAO assessment because that's what
that system is for. Um, so yeah, there
you go everybody. This is real. It's
absolutely happening. I hope everybody
has a cheery Thanksgiving and is
watching lots of football. A bunch of
people out there are not having a good
Thanksgiving. They're not going to have
a good holiday season at all. Uh and it
sounds like they're not going to have a
good 2026 either because this is getting
uh kicked off for them right there in
January. But there you go. We'll link to
the Dipk website. It has a list of all
the things that they would send you in
the email. Uh make sure you're familiar
with it because it's in your contracts.
And uh there you go. We'll see you next
week.
>> See you next week.
>> [music]
>> Hey.
