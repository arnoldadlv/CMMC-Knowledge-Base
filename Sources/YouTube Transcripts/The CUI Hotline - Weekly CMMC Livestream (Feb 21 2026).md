## Key Topics Covered

- **SaaS Providers & CMMC vs FedRAMP** - Uptick in SaaS providers reaching out; some wrongly think CMMC certification can bypass FedRAMP for multi-tenant SaaS (it cannot per NIST 800-145 definitions); separately, FedRAMP-authorized SaaS companies with professional services teams delivering to DoD need CMMC certification for the pro-serve side since it's outside their FedRAMP boundary; requires building enclave environments for support/sales teams interacting with the FedRAMP authorized boundary
- **GCC High & International Organizations** - GCC High is a completely separate tenant (not part of M365 commercial multi-geo strategy); cross-cloud collaboration requires tools like identity bridge for unified GAL syncing; non-US persons in GCC High require full segmentation from export control data via custom attribute fields and dynamic security groups; global support teams must verify US person status before supporting GovCloud
- **ITAR vs CMMC Distinction** - CMMC is not making companies do ITAR; export control regulations existed long before CMMC; however many companies first discover their export control violations when pursuing CMMC compliance; ITAR is different from CMMC but CMMC has inadvertently helped surface long-standing violations
- **CMMC Phase 1 Is Not a Deadline** - Level 2 certification requirements have been possible since Nov 10, 2025; November 2026 is start of Phase 2, not a universal deadline; use procurement administrative lead time (PALT) metrics from long-range acquisition forecasts to determine YOUR specific deadline; look at anticipated solicitation and award dates for your specific Navy syscom or customer
- **Primes Setting Deadlines** - Leidos and Elbert confirmed setting CMMC deadlines for subcontractors; construction primes lagging behind on communicating requirements because many aren't compliant themselves yet; once primes achieve compliance, expect rapid pressure on supply chain
- **Business Premium GCC High Licensing** - Microsoft now offers Business Premium in GCC High (GCCI); 30-40% cheaper than traditional GCC High licensing; 300 user limit; Purview and Defender add-ons needed; viable for small business CMMC Level 2 certification; can pass C3PAO assessment with this licensing
- **NIST 800-171 Rev 2 vs Rev 3 (GSA Requirements)** - GSA using Rev 3 while CMMC pinned to Rev 2; adopt Rev 3 ODPs now where possible; some controls differ (application allow-listing mandatory in Rev 3 vs optional in Rev 2; split tunneling more flexible in Rev 3 vs hard prohibition in Rev 2); crosswalk to higher of two standards; ask your MSP for uplift plan; Summit 7 actively building Rev 2 to Rev 3 uplift plan
- **Level 1 to Level 2 Upgrade Path** - Requires migration from commercial to compliant (FedRAMP) clouds; MSP must have SRM and show up at assessment; MSP failure = your failure; likely requires rework of Level 1 implementation
- **MSP Vetting Horror Stories (Reddit Thread)** - MSP employee asking who talks to assessors; MSP had one CCP who left, no SRM; clients sold implementations with no assessment support plan; firing MSP triggers reassessment ($40-70K); MSP selection is a 3-year minimum commitment; "trunk slammers" padding portfolios without regulatory specialization
- **FAR/DFARS Overhaul and SPRS** - DFARS 7020 basic assessments removed (redundancy with CMMC); SPRS still required under CMMC; minimum score of 88 for conditional status; below 88 = no status at all (not just a bad score, you failed); CMMC protected by FY20 NDAA Section 1648 statute; FAR overhaul cannot touch 32 CFR (CMMC lives at 32 CFR 170, FAR/DFARS at 48 CFR)
- **FIPS Encryption Requirements** - FIPS validation required only when encryption is the mechanism relied upon for CUI protection; physical compensating controls can substitute for internal traffic; external-facing appliances (firewalls) typically need FIPS; internal network appliances may not need FIPS if physically protected
- **Microsoft Business Premium & NOFORN CUI** - Business Premium in commercial does NOT satisfy NOFORN; Business Premium in GCC High DOES satisfy it; GCC High guarantees US person support and US sovereign data centers regardless of license tier
- **Cage Code Certification Issues** - Certification tied to individual cage codes; C3PAO incorrectly told client parent cage code would inherit to child JVs; unpopulated JVs in same environment still need cage code assignment in EMAS/SPRS; only C3PAOs can add cage codes to certification records; DoD cannot verify environment claims without assessment
- **Three-Year Surveillance Audits** - Conditional or final status both valid on reassessment; no indication DoD will eliminate conditional status; CMMC 2.0 limited POAMs to subset of one-point controls with 6-month closeout; future reassessments may have different POAM guidance under 3.0/4.0
- **Non-US Persons in CUI Environments** - Can operate in CUI environment unless it contains NOFORN CUI or export control data; must be segmented from export-controlled data but can access non-restricted portions
- **ESP/MSP Flow-Down Requirements** - ESPs are not subcontractors, do not have DFARS flow-down requirements; ESPs are extensions of your support team; no current certification requirement for ESPs (proposed rule had it, was removed); some MSPs voluntarily pursuing Level 2; DoD likely to eventually require ESP certification
- **CMMC Market Demand Is Real** - Thousands of companies actively pursuing CMMC despite only hundreds of completed certifications; many stuck in readiness reviews; services ecosystem and assessment ecosystem are different; companies increasingly prioritizing speed over cost; higher ed losing grants/contracts without compliance; Summit 7 tripled in size; GCC High tenant count is a litmus test for ecosystem readiness
- **RMM/MDR Tool Compliance** - Data RMM likely not FedRAMP Moderate authorized; if processing/storing/transmitting CUI, must be FedRAMP; Blackpoint MDR may have dual requirements as both SaaS tool and managed service provider; must provide SRM if doing managed SOC services
- **CIRCIA Rule Revival** - DHS reviving Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act town halls (March 19); proposed rule duplicates DFARS 7012 obligations; defense contractors are most affected sector; zero coordination between DHS and DoD

## Transcript

body. We have the intro working again. It's the vibes vibes are high on the hotline. Uh let's see. It's Friday. Daniel and I are back from hanging out at Summit 7 Live down in San Diego. We were I was joking with a bunch of people uh who are also from San Diego where we're complaining about how terrible the weather is and then all the pictures in the background it's just like sunny and nice and we're like this is a terrible day. >> It's the worst. It's the worst. Somebody's like how was your trip to San Diego? It's like well it rained which is like a natural disaster to San Diego and man and it was cold. It was like 50 something degrees. It's 75 degrees in Nashville yesterday. I'm like what the heck? >> Yeah. Terrible. I want my money back cuz it's uh it's what I'm paying for is I'm paying for it to stay around 70 all the time. All right, it's the hotline. It's Friday. We're live on YouTube. We're live on LinkedIn. You can go to cuihotline.org. You can interact with us over there. You can interact with us in chat. Uh if we don't get to your question, then we'll add it to the queue like we always do. We got a bunch of awesome stuff uh to work through today. Daniel, you have two different weekend review topics to to get through. >> First one, >> first one is providers. Yeah. So, we're actually seeing a pretty significant uptick of SAS providers reaching out and one of two things are reaching out for. Number one, they're like, "Hey, I need to be CMC certified, but they're under the wrong pretense. They think they need to be certified so they can bypass Fed ramp." And it's like, well, that's not really the case if you're a SAS application. And that includes holding multi-tenant infrastructure in like in your environment, right? So it's like if you look at the definition inside the CMCL2 scoping which points back to is it NIST 800 145 I can't remember the the where the definition anchors back to but it's like anyways long story short they come to us thinking oh I can bypass Fed ramp I just need CMT certified to help my defense customers but then on the flip side this is the one that's more interesting to me companies that either are in pursuit or have already achieved fed ramp are like we actually need to be CMMC certified and I'm like what do you mean you need to be CMMC certified? Yeah, >> they're like, "Yeah, like we have professional services that we deliver to the Department of War or other federal agencies and we're getting these requirements either for CMMC or for NIST 171 agnostic of the DoD or DO." And so now we're building enclave environments that are built for their support and sales team to interact with their Fed Ramp authorized boundary. Uh because they have to have both sides of it. They have to have the support consultant side and the sales BD side of the house as well. So anyway, it's just really interesting to see SAS providers who I guess I'd never thought about it but thought was going to be completely fine with just their Fed ram authorization, but that's not the case. All right. >> Yeah, on that note, um, I'm sure there are some people who will say, I don't need CMMC, I can just flow down 171 to do the same thing. And I just want to tell everybody here, most people who are getting reached out to by DoD components to put their SAS tools into their environments or their apps into their environments are going to be getting a CUI or CMMC requirement from that customer for their professional services operations. You've got a Fed ramp boundary, but you've also got the operations around it that are talking to the customer and so being on the operations side, a lot of people just didn't think that was a big deal. >> Yeah. >> Well, it is. So, uh and then the other thing for SAS providers who are thinking, well, I'll just get CMMC level two and then I don't need FedRAMP. It's right. That's not how it works. If your tool is a SaaS, if you are a a multi-tenant SaaS environment, your CMMC level 2 cert is for your corporate environment, for your employees. It's not for the boundary that your application is operating in. That is a FedRAMP thing. >> Yep. Absolutely. All right. >> Thought of the week number two. >> Thought of the week number two. Let's go. >> GCC high in international, international companies. So when we're talking to organizations, I work with a lot of our enterprise accounts. One of the biggest things that comes up is how does GCC High integrate with the larger commercial corporate presence, the global presence that's already there. And a couple of things to kind of be aware of when it comes to that is GCC High is not part of the multigo strategy of M365 commercial. It's not a separate data store that you can assign users to and their data for data sovereignty. It's a completely separate tenant infrastructure. So when we're looking at this, there's a couple of things to kind of be aware of. You have to set up things like crosscloud collaboration. If you want any semblance of collaboration from the gov instance to your commercial instance, you have to look at tools like identity bridge, which are thirdparty providers to do unified gal syncing. But then also as you're digging into this, you also have to look at the types of guests and the types of users. And if you have non US persons in GCC high we have to look at full segmentation of that data away from the export control right of those users away from the export control data. So now we're looking at you know custom attribute fields and dynamic security groups and a fair amount of IIA and governance that has to be done whether it's guest or licensed users in that tenant. So long story short, you can't have a single tenant instance that constitutes gov and commercial as one entity. They have to have separate domains, vanity domains. They can have a subdomain of the other one as long as it's not registered in the commercial tenant. But there's so many like little nuances as you start going through and picking this apart. Um even the global support team, right? If you have a global support team, can they actually support the GovCloud, right? If there's export control data, do they have licenses? are they US persons? All the trickle down effects, right? And so anyways, as you start getting more and more into this, you quickly realize like you have to make so many decisions before you ever look to deploy a secondary tenant that a lot of people honestly commonly overlooked because it is just looking at the technical components. Sometimes they look at collaboration, but most of the time they don't look at trade compliance requirements or regulatory compliance as well. So when you're having these conversations, make sure just to bring all the right people to the table. Luckily, we talk both sides, the technical and the compliance. So, we can kind of be a good sounding board in that, but it's really important because you're making large enterprise decisions for potentially US sites that you have that could impact the insight that and the support you're able to provide them, right? So, anyways, that's just a little more of an FYA FYI uh more than anything else. Um, just to kind of keep everyone aware that of what all the kind of basic limitations are between the two. Also, friendly reminder for everybody uh who I go back and forth with on LinkedIn seemingly every week, CMMC isn't making you do ITAR, right? Export control regulations are their own thing that existed long before CMMC was a thing. But Daniel, you and I say this all the time, the number of people that we talk to who don't start grappling with export control requirements until they get a CMMC requirement is crazy. Because there are a lot of companies out there who have been committing export control violations >> for a long time >> that had no idea until CMMC came around. Unfortunately, they blame CMMC for that. It's not how it works, people. ITAR is different from CMMC. >> Uh but it it's actually one of the things that CMC's helped with a lot even though that's not its purpose. So, >> right. >> Alrighty. Some people >> It's the tricky part. Some people want to know San Diego dates. Dustin, I don't know if you can drop the the >> registration. It's February 18th. February 18th. So, we'll try to drop the link in chat here as uh the summit 7 live in San Diego. Alrighty. Okay. All right. Family meeting everybody. Phased roll out. November of 2026 is the end of CMMC phase 1 and the start of CMMC phase two. We have said this many many times in the past. You can receive a CMMC level two certification requirement right now. You have been able to receive a level two certification requirement since November 10th of 2025. There is no DoD policy preventing them from requiring you to have a level twoert in the first 12 months in CMC phase 1. It isn't like when we get to November of 2026 magically then they can ask you to have a level two cert. That's not how the policy is written. It's never been the policy. However, people are people both inside and outside of the DoD. So that's how a lot of people have heard it, have interpreted it, think about it for whatever reason. That's fine. So, I'm sure we will see a a drastic increase in the number of level two C requirements starting in November of 2026, but it is not a deadline, right? November 10th of 2026 doesn't mean everyone who would need a level two certification must have it by that date, right? So, uh we should see a ton of them in phase one. Some people may have opted for level two self assessment. That's their prerogative. It's not how the policy is written, but I don't write the rules. Um, starting in November 2026, a lot of those requiring activities will probably say, "Okay, now we're going to require level two." That doesn't mean that's the deadline for everybody. This is part of the reason why we harp on the procurement administrative lead time metrics for your specific customer more than worrying about the intricacies or non-intricacies of the phased roll out because if you know what opportunity you specifically want to go after from what specific Navy syscom for example like we do this specific work for NAVC or we want to go after this retrofit work for NAV Air. You can go to their long range acquisition forecasts on their websites. They're just spreadsheets. You can download it, scroll down to the opportunity that you want to go after. You can filter by small business. You can filter by existing contracts. You can filter by new contracts, by contract value. And you can look at the anticipated solicitation date and the anticipated award date. The gap between a solicitation going out and awarding the contract is known as procurement administrative lead time. That award date is your deadline. That award date might be next month. That award date might be 2027. Who knows? It depends on your specific situation with your specific customer. If you're a subcontractor, this is also very useful if you know what work your prime is doing because they might be, you know, asking you to do something for CMMC for something they're not planning on taking a ward of until 2028. You can see that in the spreadsheets. So, November of 2026 is not a deadline for everyone. It might be a deadline for you. The only way to know is to look at those pulp metrics for your opportunity or for your upstream customer. So, not a deadline. Not a deadline. We don't have to have a 100,000 level twoerts by November. It would be cool. It's not going to happen. And it's also not required. >> Yep. And a lot of people I don't think a lot of people are looking upstream far enough because the conversations I'm having, some people either like, "My prime just told me I've got to be certified by a certain time." Like, I've heard that from Lidos. We've had conversations with Elbert. You and Sprer have on the podcast. Like we've heard this from multiple sources like primes are setting deadlines. Um but some primes aren't saying anything. I'm actually seeing this a lot in the construction space. A lot of primes in the construction world haven't been communicating well CMMC requirements because a lot of them aren't compliant yet themselves, right? And so it's very interesting like your prime might not be posting things, putting cyber security releases out to the supply chain because they might not be there yet. But once they're there, you better believe they're going to start communicating and expecting it out of you pretty quickly. >> Yeah. This is a uh put your put your oxygen mask on before you help people next to you. Except once they put the oxygen mask on you, you got to go run a marathon, right? >> Yeah. Exactly. >> Actually, they might not be putting the oxygen mask on you because that implies that they're helping you directly. They're just telling you. They put their mask on and then they're like, "You better put your mask on. >> We're going down." >> Man. Man, there's there's some potential there for a meme. All righty. Uh, can I pass a C3PAO assessment using Business Premium GCC High as my primary CUI environment? >> Oo, great question. And the short answer is yes. So, Microsoft just became a lot more businessfriendly. So, we worked with Microsoft to say, hey, we're trying to lower the cost burden of CMMC on small businesses, right? because you have your 20 30 40 50 person companies that are like we have to do this because it's core to our business but we can afford to pay so much more in Microsoft licensing just for basically the same experience right and so we work with Microsoft we came up with a kind of a small business solution set to help people one of those things being business premium and yes you can get compliant with business premium in GCCI which was a newer license that they dropped in January of this year. Um, so that's really good. It's a I think it's like 40% cheaper, 30 to 40% cheaper than traditional GCC High licensing. Um, which is great. So, if you're a small business, whether already in GCC High or looking to make a move, um, now's the time and you can come in at a cheaper price point. Now, there are limitations. You can only have 300 of them. So, if you're a big company, that's problematic. If you're doing an enclave, you could use this licensing. If it's a small subset of your users, um you just can't have three more than 300 licensed users with business premium in it. Um we add on the uh purview and defender suites used to be called the G5 security, G5 compliance suite, but Microsoft loves changing names um to make sure that it's rounded out from all the managed service components to meet CMMC as well. So there's a couple of small add-ons there. Um, but it's still significantly cheaper uh than what it used to be to go like a full G5 or something of that nature. So, yes, you could actually pass an assessment with small business licensing in CMMC. >> Nice. Awesome. >> All righty. Hi there. With the new GSA requirements for handling CUI, they specifically are using NIST 8001 171 Rev 3 while CMMC is still pinned to Rev 2. What would be the best way to handle this? Uh, yeah. So, for those of you who are not aware, Daniel and I, uh, not too long ago did a podcast that covered the update to the I don't even remember the horrible name that they picked for it, the GSA program that they're using to verify uh, NIS 800171 requirements for their CUI in nonfederal systems. uh they are not using at least in this document they are not using CMMC certifications to prove that people have met 171 they are using basically RMF uh the risk management framework they're evaluating everybody's assessment report from Fed ramp 3 PAOS for their 171 environment on a case-byase basis uh which is not advisable because it's expensive it's going to take forever ever. And uh there's a reason why the DoD didn't do the RMF approach. They preloaded all of it into the CMFC approach. Anyways, that set of requirements says 171 rev 3. As we all know, DoD contractors are required to implement 171 rev 2. My first thought here, Daniel, is the best way to handle this is that DoD is definitely uh pushing harder for people to prove their implementations based off what we've seen than GSA. Uh DoD wants to push everybody up to Rev 3. They're they're publishing the ODPS for Rev 3 and parameters. We're expecting Rev3 guidance to come out with the upcoming CMMC 3.0 rule hopefully in a few months. Um, my first thought is that most people are working with an MSP. The best way to sleep peacefully at night is to make sure that your MSP has a plan. >> Yes. >> Because most people who are listening to this podcast probably aren't on the keyboard all the time. So, you need to make sure that your MSP has do they have an uplift plan? Do they have a transition plan? Do they know what's going on with Rev 3? Uh, you know, are there pricing changes? like what's going on with agreements and you know service level agreements and things like that. Uh that's my first thought is it's really a question to your MSP. What do you think? >> Uh MSP is definitely really important if you're using a managed service provider. They're the one that should be helping you steer this ship, right? Because you likely probably don't know about all the nuances between Rev 2 and Rev 3. So there's a couple things just to kind of loosely be aware of. Number one, if you already have a Rev 2 implementation, go ahead and try and adopt the ODPs. Or if you haven't started yet in your CMMC level 2 Rev 2 implementation, go ahead and look at those ODPs and try and implement those as core because a lot of the controls still align to what's in Rev 2. Um, however, there's nuances too, right? So, application allow listing or deny listing. Um, that's optional. You get to pick which one in Rev 2. In Rev 3, not optional. allow listing only. Right? And so when you start going through this, you realize, oh, I might have to default to a higher of the two standards that maybe Rev Two gave me options on, right? Split tunneling is another interesting thing as well, right? When it comes to that, right, because split tunneling, uh, the hard don't do in Rev 2. Rev three has some more leeway when it comes to split tunneling. And so you have to go basically to the higher of the two standards when it comes to it. Some of those higher standards are going to be in rev two. Some of those higher standards are going to be in rev three. So you have to crosswalk that appropriately. Try and integrate the ODPs. Talk to your MSP. Talk to your IT team and and try and figure out how you can systematically kind of upgrade the environment into Rev3. I don't really see a world where you're going to have to have two environments. Luckily, I think there's a path forward to be able to have a single environment to meet both. Um, and they'll they'll almost have to be, right, in the sense of when you look at CMMC, likely CMMC 3.0 is going to come out, you're still going to have CMMC 2.0, I'll call it requirements through your certification. You won't have to get reertified within that window, but there's going to be new requirements with new solicitations on DR721 with the level the 3.0 requirements. Long story short, it's a lot of words. you should be able to incrementally do it um with building with off rev two and then building up to rev three. >> Yeah, I guess a good half step too whether you're doing the implementation or not is you can use the 173 ODPS right now. Uh there's nothing preventing you from using those defined values in your 171R2 environment. Uh and that wouldn't involve any new controls or anything like that. Those are just parameters and configurations. So that's a good place to uh consider starting. John John asked, "Does Summit 7 have an uplift plan to go from rev two to rev three?" Yeah, we do. Uh we're working uh through that process with some of our more aggressive early adopters that are very eager to get going. But yep, we got that on the road map. Uh got that in I mean they have meetings about it every week, I think. So Patrick Gable Patrick Gable is spearheading that on our product management team. though because here's the interesting part. We've got to uplift our implementation services but also have alignment of that in our managed services, right? Because if we're implementing it, we need to have the same means and control matrix to be able to support it. So, um, a lot of moving parts there. >> Absolutely. Alrighty. We're a small company around 12 people and just found out we need to go from CMMC level one to CMMC level two. Where do we start? We have an MSP. We're not thrilled with them. >> So, this is where it gets a little confusing if you're the client in this situation. So, the first thing out of the gate that I always tell people is if you're in level one, you're probably still in commercial versions of your clouds, specifically non-fed ramped versions, right? So if you were to upstep to level two, one of the big transformation that has to happen is implementation of compliant clouds and migration to those compliant clouds. Okay, that's one thing. The other thing is the MSP side of the house, right? So if your MSP doesn't have the means of like a shared responsibility matrix, the technical aptitude to implement or know the nuances of gov services versus commercial services, those are going to be stumbling blocks to get you to CMMC level two because CMMC level two requires an external service provider to show up to your assessment. This is inside of the CAP to be able to speak to the controls that they're supporting on your behalf. they have to produce evidence that they've been doing it, right? So, it is not a trivial thing to partner with an MSP that is trying to get into this space because you're putting a lot of risk because if they fail as part of your assessment, you fail. Like they're not judging you two separately. They're judging you as one certification boundary, right? >> Which is can be somewhat problematic, right? So, um long story short, try and find a good MSP that has an SRM. the MSP collective, great website to use to start looking and assessing those. Um, we're releasing a webinar on CMMC RFP creation. So, that's a really good will be a really good template for you to use as well here in the next couple of weeks. Um, but yeah, there's a lot of moving parts there and the timeline sadly, you'll probably have to recreate a lot of the work you did in level one because it maybe was implemented on non-compliant cloud environments, right? So, there would probably be a level of rework there, too. >> Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, there's no DR712 maturity model, right? Uh it's just it's just a a big jump. So, uh that webinar is February 25th, by the way. So, uh maybe producer Dustin can put the link in chat for registration for the webinar um for RFP. Speaking of which, there was a Reddit thread, a spicy Reddit thread on this exact topic. So, it's very important to vet your MSP, everybody. very very important to pick who you uh are going to partner with on this journey because you might just so happen to get sold a contract with an MSP who then has an anonymous employee go on Reddit and ask a theoretical question. >> Theoretical of course >> if an MSP built and manages your level two environment who is responsible for talking to the auditor. This is the employee of the MSP talking right? So, our MSB builds us a level two environment. Who's responsible for talking to the assessor? The number one upvoted answer, which is correct, is you are MSP. You ever heard of the shared responsibility model? Do you have an SRM? Like, did you just is it all just vibes where you're like, we got it. How hard could it be? Um this is nightmare scenario because I am sure that the client on the other end of uh this MSP has no idea that they are asking questions that displays that the MSP has no idea what they're doing uh in terms of supporting them during this assessment. I think during some of the other comments on the Reddit thread, they were like, "Yeah, we had a CCP on staff and they left and then it kind of went by the wayside and now I'm being told that I got to figure all this out. This is the MSP, by the way. What do you think, Daniel? You ever ever hear ever hear of this happening before or is this >> I think it's the tail's oldest time. I'm gonna Are you okay if I pull up the Reddit thread, Jacob? Just because Yeah. So, >> what I I You hate >> This is the R This is the rmmc subreddit, everybody. >> Yeah, great resource. Um this was the actual kind of question here when it comes to and you guys can find this on the subreddit as well. Yeah. uh you are share responsibility, right? And so this was logical process by mind, but I'm fairly new to all this. >> Yeah. Thanks. Thanks to Dick Official Pike for that correct answer. >> Yeah. He here's the hard part. We know people are trying to to do the best for their client. And that's very like should be applauded with trying to put forth the effort and learn more. This is not a stab at people trying to understand. This is more of a realization. You as a buyer of services through a managed service, you have to become the educated buyer on having these conversations with your managed service provider, right? Because you don't know where they stand. Or worse yet, if their one CCP uh that's on staff leaves and that person was the wealth of knowledge and now the MSP can't really function in that capacity without that person because a lot of MSPs don't run multiple uh people deep when it comes to compliance and regulatory requirements. Like if that one person goes, are you screwed now? So like understanding like are they an MSP focused in the defense industrial base? Do they have clients? Have they been through certifications? How many? Like, because this is happening more and more, Jacob. I think I've been on here, I don't know how many episodes. We're at 80ome probably now or close to it. Like I think probably every five episodes I tell a story or live stream I tell a story of a a client coming to us saying my MSP told me that they would get me compliant gave me a handshake deal. It wasn't in our contracts and decided to not show up for our certification and bow out because they weren't able to fulfill the requirements either themselves or to actually be able to show up. So um the problem here and this is where you need to look at your contracts. A lot of uh unless you have CMMC built into your contract, a lot of MSPs are forcing their clients to pay out the remainder of their term before they switch to another CMMC MSP. Right? So again, you've got to watch yourself. You've got to be an educated buyer because you've got to know their capacity, their limitations, and if they're going to actually get you across the finish line and continue to be able to support you. Listen, the not so nice term uh in the MSP industry for a lot of other MSPs are trunk slammers, right? These are they're trying to they're just trying to pad their portfolio with as many clients as possible. They're not in general specialists in this specific type of regulated work. Be very careful, man. I'm scrolling through these comments. They are mindblowing, dude. uh the the guy who was saying uh the who works for the MSP was saying that these uh these client uh projects were sold with the intention that we would continue to manage them like any other client. That's a whole other can of worms we need to deal with. But for now, I assume that an SRM is the best option. Sounds like we need to draw up an SRM for co-management and quickly. They don't even have one. Yeah, it's it's it's problematic. Like, >> yeah, we are the MSP. We had a CCP, but they transferred to a parent company. Everything has degraded since then. The only thing resembling a SRM we have for my projects is a third-party consultant that we brought in for a level one that we're about to start. Oh my god. Oh my god. Well, that's a It's like driving past a car crash. What a what a horrible situation. I really hope those clients don't get screwed. >> So, another comment here that we see here in the chat on LinkedIn is what if the client fired the MSP? And this is really problematic because your M if you have an MSP likely your SPS score, which we'll have a whole another conversation about, I'm sure because isn't SPRS dead now, uh, Jacob? Um, but your SPRS score is likely tied to and your CMMC score is likely tied to so much work that that MSP is supposedly doing on your behalf. If you fire your MSP, you need to reassess your CMMC score. You could go from, you know, an 88, which is minimum, to a negative something, right? And so when you start looking at this, it it's very problematic to fire your MSP. And with significant change language, it's an easy justification to say moving MSPs is a significant change. So if you've already been certified on with your MSP, switching partners would likely trigger a reertification and you're out 40 50 60 $70,000 depending on typically your size and scope just because you fired your MSP. So picking who you're going to be a partner with in this, it's a three-year commitment at a minimum for the life cycle of your C. And then before your renewal, make that decision. Talk about that transition and what that looks like. And you have a small window to offboard and onboard when it comes to that. >> Yeah, absolutely. Alrighty, let's see here. Catching up on chat. Uh, isn't SP aren't >> aren't aren't SPRS updates still needed to comply with 32 CFR like yearly compliance self attestation between an OSA? Yeah. Okay. So uh this is referring to the FAR and DEFARS overhaul process. So uh under that overhaul process DAR 7020 no longer requires you to conduct a basic self assessment and then upload a score to SPS. However, CMMC does. Right? So if you do a self assessment under CMMC or if you do your annual affirmation regardless of your obligation under CMMC, you're still uploading those things into SPS. This is why SPS had two different tabs. They had a 7020 compliance tab and then a CMMC tab. Right? If you have a third party run your assessment, they're uploading your stuff into EMAS. It gets populated into SPS. If you do a self assessment, you upload your stuff into SPS on your own. So the overhaul change to 7020 doesn't mean that SPSS is irrelevant. It just means you don't have to do it twice, a self assessment for 7020 and a self assessment under CMMC and then enter the same score in the same system multiple times, right? It reduces the redundancy. So SPRS hasn't gone away. It's why in the title we got a little piffy with it and we were saying uh you know SPS scores are no more. sort of sort of they are under the pursuant to DAR 7020. Uh now that is Dar's clause 252247997. Nailed it. Nailed it. So SPRS is still absolutely a thing. Scores in SPRS are still absolutely a thing. But it's all under the guise of CMMC. Not the carryover for the DoD assessment methodology from the 2020 rule. uh which is a good change. It's a good change because if they hadn't gotten rid of basic assessments in 7020, you would have to conduct a basic self- assessment in SPS and then if you got a level two self- assessment, you'd do the same thing and then you'd have to upload it twice and it's just a bunch of stuff to deal with. So rare W for the rulemakers here to actually remove the redundancy. And because it's an overhaul, it didn't have to go through rulemaking. They just got rid of it. So, DAR 7021, the CMMC clause has a minimum SPRS score of 88 for conditional status. The other thing people are not talking about is SPRS under 7020 because that's now blown up basically for basic assessments, meaning you don't have to self attest to your score without being under CMMC. If you're under CMMC, you do. And so, but a lot of people are still keeping their same score in SPRS thinking it's not a problem. It's very much a problem because if you don't have the minimum viable score under your CMMC section, you cannot be awarded contracts. So like there is now a minimum spur score that you have to meet with all contracts coming with the DR721 that allow for self addestation, meaning your primes are also probably going to require an 88 as well here in the near future. Again, anything below that is just nonviable at this point. Well, here's the thing is in the past under 7020, you could enter a negative 150 or a negative -200 or >> still be awarded contracts >> or or a 12 under CMMC there is no such thing as a conditional status below an 88. So, if you don't have at least that score, you don't have status, right? It isn't a question of like we have a bad score. You don't have anything at all. you would fail your self assessment which wasn't possible under DAR 7020 right uh if you have less than a perfect score but more than an 88 you have conditional self assessment status 87 or less it's you don't have a status you just don't have anything at all you failed right >> Jonathan said you can still see my giant bald head uh Jonathan said hi um is it correct to assume that the FIPS encryption requirements under CMMC level 2 uh 31311 apply only when encryption is used as the primary means to protect CUI, external transmission of CUI, hard drives that may leave the facility and are not required for all encryption occurring within the CUI environment, standalone servers and secured areas, internal application traffic. >> Great question. >> Yeah. So, Go for it. >> No, go for it. Go for it. >> No, you No, no, please. >> Okay, I will. >> I insist. >> So, you can do physical protection of CUI or you can do encryption like you get a choice there basically on how you're defining things, right? So, a really common example is firewalls externally externally facing will be FIPS validated, right? But my internal traffic, I might not have FIPS validation because I'm allowing physical compensating controls of those systems, right? They're not externally facing. They're internal. I can control them, locks on doors, whatever it might be, right? And so when you're looking at it, you know, you can have network appliances depending on how they're scoped enable FIPS or not enable FIPS, right? Depending on how where they're located and things like that. So FIPS is meant for the protection of CUI. It can be internally, it can be externally. Um, or you can use physical compensating controls obviously assuming it can actually be protected that traffic and that CUI data can be protected. You don't have to encrypt absolutely everything if it can meet physical uh protection requirements. >> Yeah, I believe the line that they have is when encryption is the method that you use to I can't remember the exact wording. We'll look it up. Right. We'll probably we can we can we can do some more but yeah there's actually a specific wording where it's like when encryption is the mechanism that you're relying on for the protection of cui that encryption must be fits validated right um I I believe is how they phrased it. So yeah when you're relying on the encryption alone which is exactly how you phrase it John so there we go. Uh alrighty. Uh let's see. Would Micros would a Microsoft premium tenant satisfy the no foreign limited dissemination control? >> It would not. So to clarify that a little bit more, a Microsoft uh business premium license and commercial would not. A Microsoft business premium GCC high tenant would. And it all comes down to really two primary questions here. Question number one is, what is Microsoft's contractual obligation to you? In commercial, they're not obligating only US person support regardless of the license. In GCC High, regardless of the license, they're saying they'll only provide US person support and the data will stay in the United States. US sovereign data centers. So, GCC high agnostic of license, business premium or not, will meet that requirement. business premium in a commercial tenant will not meet that requirement. >> Gotcha. Uh yeah, sorry. Hey, no need to apologize for the wacky English. English is a wacky language. What is that? What is that phrase? It's uh English is really three different languages on each other's shoulders wearing a trench coat pretending to be one language. It English is a crazy that's a whole other that's a whole other podcasting pot, if you will. >> My my dabbling in linguistics here. All right. Uh, John shouted, "Any idea on whether three-year surveillance audits will allow less than 110 scores just like the first time assessment does conditional?" Any idea whether and then he whispered, "Any idea on whether threeear surveillance will allow less than one?" Yeah. So when you go for your reassessment every three years, uh, conditional or final status is still perfectly valid. Um now if you go through your assessment like uh next month and then three years uh later you need to reassess maybe CMMC guidance has changed in terms of what can be on the POAM or what point values are which or this and that. Um but there's no indication whatsoever that the DoD is going to go do away with conditional status on uh assessments whether they're self assessments or C3POA assessments every 3 years. This was one of the big debates going from 1.0 to 2.0. CMC 1.0. They said no poems. It's all or nothing. People didn't like that. And so they said fine, you can have poams sort of. And uh they were like a a handful of these onepoint controls. Sure, we'll give you six months to finish implementing those. So just be aware that by the time your reassessment comes up, maybe the POM guidance will have changed if we're on 3.0 or 4.0 or who knows what. by the time your reassessment comes up. But yeah, as of this point, um, an assessment is assessment. Conditional final are the two statuses that could happen. Alrighty. Uh, oh, related to your uh thought of the week, Daniel, can non US persons operate in my CUI environment? >> They can, unless it's no foreign cui or export control data, then they can still operate within the environment. They just can't access that kind of data. >> Gotcha. Okay, here we go, everybody. >> We got a big one. >> We're being told we need a new certification to add a ch a cage code to our existing certifications. These are unpopulated joint ventures within our same environment. Why is another certification required? So, I got to talk to this individual, uh, a colleague here at Summit 7, Lauren Shout out, got this email from a friend of his. He forwarded it to me. I jumped on the phone with him and and here's kind of the sequence of events. Just for more context, they went and got certified almost a year ago. So, they they they've had a certification by a C3PAO. The C3PO stated, "Oh, you don't need to add multiple cage codes. you can just add the one at the parent level and it'll inherit all cage codes below it. Well, so when they went to go submit the CMMCR, they only have the single cage code listed. They didn't have multiple cage codes to recognize and tie the cert to. So they have all these other cage codes leveraging the same environment, but the cage codes in SPRS and EMAS weren't assigned to the certification. just the other just the primary cage code was because of that they went to go do work and bid a contract and they were like so sorry that cage code isn't CMMC certified they were like what do you mean it's part of our boundary we said we thought we were okay so now he's having to go back to the C3PAO and see if they'll resubmit the EMAS package and if it'll require a new certification or a kind of a I'll call it a delta certific ification, which isn't a CMMC technical term, but you know, kind of a a quick run through to make sure nothing's changed, or if they're just going to allow the bundling of those other cage codes because they're basically empty, right? They're JBs. There's not additional infrastructure or anything running in them right now. So, um, so long story short, because of significant change language and the way that people tie to cage codes, only C3POs can do that. That's it. >> You cannot do that as a legal entity. And so because of that, you you gotta get them involved. >> Yeah. From the DoD's perspective, they don't know that they're unpopulated joint ventures. Like that's what you say it is. How do they know? Right. And I mean, there are there's definitely some drawbacks to tying assessment status to individual cage codes when cage codes can sometimes be pretty fluid or very numerous. Um, and this is one of those situations, right, where uh some people will try to game the system by getting one environment certified and then just add a bunch of cage codes in afterwards and then uh it opens the back door to a bunch of uh assurance gaps for the department. Whereas in a situation like this, perfectly reasonable uh that they would want to add these cage codes there and they're stuck because of the risk of people gaming the system because put on the DoD's perspective, they don't know like how they're just going to take everybody's word for it that you get a certification tied to one cage code and then you add a dozen of them six months later. What the heck are those? Are those different environments? Are they different systems? They have no idea. Um so yeah, takes a lot of careful planning up front. I've seen people say, "Well, the cage code changed, but the control environment didn't change." The DoD doesn't know. They don't have any assurance that that's actually true. I've heard some people talking about ways to change the way that things are populated from SAM.gov over to the record in SPSS. Hopefully, that works in the future, but as of right now, uh, not the way that the process works. So be very careful in terms of cage code changes, anticipated cage code changes uh for your environment because pretty sure that's going to be something that Dipk looks for um if uh people try to change records or anything like that. >> Alrighty. Oh my god. Okay. Perfectly reasonable. Perfectly reasonable. I love this question. We love all questions equally here on the CUI hotline. The FAR DFARS overhaul. Removing basic assessments means that CMMC is on the chopping block, everybody. False alarm. This was all for nothing. CMMC is doomed. Here we go. Right. Uh, no, that is not true. The FAR and DEFARS overhaul removed the basic self- assessment requirement from DAR's clause 7020 in order to remove the duplicative requirement to do basic self assessments in 7020 and CMMC level two selfassessments. Same scoring, same assessment, same requirements. you got to do it pursuant to two different clauses as of November 10th of 2025 don't make no sense. So they use the uh uh the FAR overhaul as an opportunity to take that part out of DFARS 7020. If you go back and you watch our podcast on the FAR DFARS overhaul or if you go to any of the links in the show notes and read about it yourself, they are very clear about the things in the FAR and the DFARS that they are keeping. They are keeping anything primarily that has a statutory requirement. Beyond that, they're keeping anything that they want for uh the purpose of good and efficient acquisitions. But the main things that they're keeping is everything that the law says needs to be in the FAR and the DEFARS. Guess what? CMMC is required by the FY20 NDAA. If you go to the CMMC final rule or you go to 32 CFR 170 and you read at the very top, it will say that the statutory basis for the CMMC program is 30 is sorry F the FY20 NDAA section 1648. Uh that is the statutory requirement. It's been there since 2020. And so as a result there is no FAR overhaul that removes CMMC because CMMC program is codified at 32 CFR. FAR and DEFARS is at 48 CFR. It couldn't remove it even if they wanted to because they can't change a different title of uh the code of federal regulations. So the subsequent clause DFR721 and the provision DR725 that implements the 32 CFR COC program also will not go away required by statute. So it's a reasonable question. People hear stuff and they're like, "Hey, they're getting rid of these assessments. Why wouldn't they get rid of those assessments?" Not that simple. Not that simple. Uh I love this one. I I I threw this one in there for for my own. Boy, did I have a toxic interaction with know-it-all person on LinkedIn yesterday. Daniel, the CMC market is fake. Uh there is no demand for CMMC because there are only a few hundred level twoerts. There are many thousands, tens of thousands, 100 thousand, nobody really knows. companies that need CMMC level two and there are only a few hundred that have pursued it because there are only a few hundreds. This immediately gave me what felt like an aneurysm because the number of successful certifications is not the number of people pursuing CMMC. As we know, there are a lot of people who are getting false starts because they're signing up for assessments and they can't get out of the readiness review to actually even start the assessments. For what I tried to explain to this person is that the assessment ecosystem and the services ecosystem are two different parts of the CMMC world. Daniel, I've heard you say this. I've heard a bunch of people on the team say this recently. More and more people are calling us and they're less worried about price and they're more worried about time because they are getting hyper pressure from their customer, their prime customer, their government customer, whoever to go get this done. Is this all fake? Are we making this all up? Has Summit 7 tripled in size because of a myth? What's going on here? >> I can honestly tell you it's not fake. um just because of the conversations I've had this week from small businesses to enterprises and everything in between. One of the conversations I had was with a higher education um research facility who had been in progress of this CMMC thing for quite some time. Turns out they're probably not as far as they as they would like to be and now it's gotten up to the to the president's desk, right? because they're like, "We're losing grants and contracts right now because we don't have this." And out of the words were said, "Daniel, it is less about money and way more about time because we can't have PIs, principal investigators or researchers leaving our university. We want to attract researchers. They bring money into the university." But not just higher ed and and research. Every vertical, construction, I'm seeing it in manufacturing, of course. I'm seeing it like in SAS providers like that's one kind of oddly overlooked like SAS providers even though they might have Fed ramp guess what they have a proserve team typically we're doing professional services and they're winning defense contracts to do professional services around their application that's their pro-serve is not part of their fed ramp boundary they got to get CMMC certified it is touching every major industry right now and everybody is I literally had a 22minute conversation this morning and the result of it is we have to move fast. We have a deadline. Let's do it right now. And I had just met them, right? Because of the pressure they're feeling from their primes and from the DoD directly. And they don't want to miss out on solicitations because they're afraid if they miss one with their prime and say, "We can't do it or meet it." The prime's going to start turning off the tap and they can't afford to have the tap turned off. >> Yeah, absolutely. Oh, man. This is boy, this is the one that uh I love this stat more than anything. People don't talk about it a whole lot, but everybody's like, "Oh yeah, the ecosystem is totally ready." Uh all the DoD has to do is ask Microsoft how many GCC high tenants even exist. Uh and if the number is a tiny fraction of the amount of companies out there handling export controlled CUI that have DAR 712 obligations, then the DoD instantly knows not everybody is ready. They've been able to find this number for Microsoft the whole time. They have the Dipk backend data where they can see the scores and the arbitrary POM dates. That's a whole other can of worms, but man is that a spicy one where everybody's like Yeah, it's a great lipus test. Now, you can be on GCC, you can be on GCCI. Like everyone, I'm immediately addressing the naysayers that are probably thinking, "Oh, I don't have to use GCCI." The majority of people do, though, and and it's a really really good lip test to say, how many tenants are there? And it's probably a a close equation uh to how many people are are actively compliant or pursuing compliance. >> Yeah. Or, you know, DoD has meetings with these guys all the and they can just call up all the cloud providers and be like, "How many regulated tenants are do you even have?" >> It ain't 100 thousand, but across all of them. So, there you go. Uh, all righty. Let's see here. Uh, MSP is using data RMM and Blackpoint for MDR. Not a fan of either. A client's auditor told us the reporting isn't sufficient for CMMC level two. I'm stuck and not sure how to get the info he's looking for. What do you think here, Daniel, in terms of RMM tools and MDR tools for providing evidence? I don't know these specific solutions and whether they're sufficient or not, but how's that work on the back end for reporting and things? >> Reporting isn't sufficient for CMT. I'm stuck and not sure how to get the Okay, so there's two ways to look at this. If they're an external service provider, not a SAS provider. So this is where it gets interesting. Data RMM is going to be a SAS platform. If they're processing, storing, and transmitting CUI, that platform is not Fed ramp. So I don't Fed ramp moderate or I don't even think it's equivalent. So you can't use that platform. And he might be asking, you know, or she might be asking, hey, is there equivalency? They need to prove that for data RMM, right? If they can't, they're not compliant. You can't use them if it's processing, storing, or transmitting CUI. Blackpoint MDR that's a little bit different SAS potentially SAS tools involved probably Fed ramp requirements as well again depending on how the EDR tool or MDR tools working but also they might be doing managed sock services for you so they are a service provider because they're doing the monitoring and isolation and remediation meaning an external or a customer responsibility matrix or SRM would be pro have to be provided so there's a little bit of nuance here depending on what types of services they're providing. Is it cloud only? Is it cloud plus support services? On what kind of evidence has to be gathered to justify or prove that that they are meeting the requirements on your behalf? Awesome. All right, let's see here. Uh more quick linguistic nerd uh tangent here. English is the kind of language that'll follow you down the alley and knock you over to rumage through your pockets for loose grammar. Yeah. Uh here's a fun one. Uh in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, at night. Explain that one everybody. Uh explain that one. Anyways, >> true or false? External service providers are not subcontractors on defense contracts and therefore do not have flow down requirements. You're an MSP. Your client has CMMC level two. Do you then have CMMC level two, Daniel? No, I don't have to be CMMC level two. So, we still saw this a lot with D4712 flow downs. A lot of organizations were like, I need to flow this down to you. It's like, well, you you don't I'm an extension of your organization by being an ESP, but I'm not actually executing the contract. I'm an extension of your support team. Um, that's why there's independent requirements for ESPs. And right now, there's no certification requirement around ESPs, MSPs, etc. I anticipate quite honestly that will probably end up changing because the DoD in the proposed rule wanted MSPs and ESPs to be certified. Uh they backed down from that to play nice with the industry, but anything that they wanted they'll probably end up getting in the long run. Uh is probably a fair assumption. Yeah, I think um you know the proposed rule for 32 CFR170 did have the requirement for external service providers to achieve certification and that would have really made things a lot simpler because you wouldn't end up with Reddit threads like the one that we end talked about earlier where they just don't even know who's responsible for talking to assessors. So now the pressure is on the buyer uh in order to figure out what's going on. However, there are some MSPs out there who have their level two either because they themselves are contractors or they just opted to go do it. Uh, which is a good question to ask if you're figuring out who you'd like to work with. Uh, do they walk the walk? Uh, besides just sort of Pinky promising you that everything's going to be okay. All righty, Daniel. 30 seconds left. Easy one. What's the difference between ITAR and CUI? >> CUI has a law, regulation, or governmentwide policy. It can only exist on behalf of a federal contract and it's not all federal contracting data. There's also FCI as part of that as well. ITAR can apply to both commercial products and products that you're delivering on behalf of a federal contract. ITAR CUI can also be ITAR. ITAR can also be CUI. Again, in performance of a federal contract, but ITAR can be by itself, too. ITAR can exist. If I'm selling a gun overseas, ITAR is going to play a part in it. even if it's not for a federal contract. >> Nice. 37 seconds. Well done. Well done. Give it up for Daniel. You heard it here first. Well, hopefully you didn't hear about it here first because that would be that would be a problem. >> Okay, that's an hour. We do this every Friday. I'll try not to mess up the scheduling next week. Uh if you find this stream afterwards on YouTube or LinkedIn, you can leave your questions and comments. We'll add them to the queue. You can go to cuihotline.org and find us over there. You can leave a question in the form. You can leave a voicemail. We've got uh Summit 7 Live next week, February 8, >> February 18th. Uh registration link was in chat earlier. You and I have a webinar coming up the week after, February 25th. The registration link is also in the chat. They're both free. And uh be sure to check my LinkedIn page earlier and register for the Circia Defense Town Hall coming up March 19th at 12 Eastern. very important that everybody participate. There you go everybody. I'm pretty sure I don't know if the outro is going to play or not. Hey, the outro is going to play. All right, we'll see you next week.
