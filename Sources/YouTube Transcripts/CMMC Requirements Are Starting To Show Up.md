[Music]
All right, folks. It is almost the end
of October of 2025. And if you remember
way back in the day, the 48 CFR CMMC
final rule was published in the Federal
Register on September 10th of 2025. The
regulation officially goes into effect
on November 10th of 2025, at which point
all new DoD solicitations and contracts
will include at least CMMC level one
status requirements. While the
government shutdown might affect the
pace of new contracts, it doesn't change
anything about the effective date of the
CMMC program and contracts specifically.
So, even though SAM.gov is very quiet at
the moment thanks to the shutdown, we
have seen seven notices coming out that
let people know that CMMC is very real
and will absolutely be required
including some level two requirements
and that's what we're going to talk
about today.
>> Okay, first and foremost, let's get it
out of the way. The elephant in the
room, seven notices. We had no influence
over that whatsoever. Um, and then the
only other thing that I have going into
this episode, Jacob, uh, is, uh, my
question is, is this a case where, um,
people were following 7304 too far and
they didn't remove it when maybe the
class deviation came out or things of
that nature, right? The requirements
within the contracts. I'm also
interested to see if we're seeing it in
seven contracts, what kind of contracts
are they? Are they really high-speed
contracts? Are they what what's it going
to be? So, I'm really excited for this.
>> Yeah. No. And these are all either new
uh or up these are all either new
notices or requests or they're updates
to things that were published just prior
to the rule being published itself. Uh
and we'll see that as we sort of walk
through them. But yeah, these are not
mistakes. These are actually, you know,
what it's going to look like in the in
the brave new world that we're going to
be in after November 10th. So, first up,
the Navy has a notice on SAM.gov under
Naval Sea Systems Command. They have a
request for information on
semiconductors and related device
manufacturing. The Navy is looking for
information related to establishing a US
onshore 300 millimeter wafer production
fabrication capability for
magnetoresistive random access memory
devices utilizing magnetic tunnel
junction technology with a focus on
production foundry capabilities. Uh
that's what they're looking for. There's
all kinds of cool stuff that you see on
SAM.gov. However, if you scroll through
this uh this notice, this RFI on
SAM.gov, they say at a minimum, the
envisioned US onshore fabrication
capability shall meet the following
requirements. And they give you a big
list. And inside of that list, it says
shall be able to support an ITAR
compliant manufacturing flow, including
at a minimum CMMC level two for the
protection of customers controlled
unclassified information categorized as
export controlled. They say that the
requirement for this ITAR CUI compliance
is driven by the need for this random
access memory manufacturing capability
in radiation hardened memory
microcircuits customd designed to meet
specific natural space and man-made
radiation environments. If you're doing
micro electronics manufacturing, if
you're doing reshoring of high-speed
manufacturing of micro electronics,
nextgen things like that, high-speed
fabrication, they're straight up saying
it's going to be CMMC level two, not
CMMC itself assessment, CMMC level two.
So, this is a Navy Sea Systems Command
RFI. And they say it right there. They
say it right in the uh right in the RFI
on there.
>> So, right out of the gates, uh we see a
contradiction to what everybody seems to
think, right, Jacob? uh the phased roll
out begins. Oh, we're going to have
level one requirements inside of our
contracts, but here the very first
solicitation that we see says uh not
only is it level two, but it's specified
CUI level two on this mag. I'm not even
going to try the who's
>> they're making microchips that go into
radiation in, you know, radiation
hardened microchips for some crazy
space-based application that is super
export controlled. Yeah, it doesn't
sound like something that you would want
level one controls, making sure that
that security is in place or you want to
take somebody's word on it. We want to
make sure this stuff's locked down so it
doesn't get out there. It sounds like a
lot of money spent on it. But with that
being said, like I mentioned at the at
the beginning of the comment is that
this is already a contradiction to what
people's belief is right now. The belief
is I'm only going to have to self
assess. I'm only going to have to do
level one. The very first solicitation
that we talk about, bam.
>> Yeah. Level two, which you know, it's an
RFI. So reach out to NAVC and tell them
you can't do it and you need an
exception or tell them you can't.
>> Kind of crazy that it came from Navy
too, right? I I I would in our
experience Navy I think has been the one
where there's more explaining that's
needed, right? And then all of a sudden
they're just out the gates bam bam bam.
>> Yeah. So and this is only one thing,
right? I mean obviously there's going to
be a million different RFIs, RFPs,
notices on SAM.gov, especially once
things open back up. But, you know,
we've been we've been shouting from the
rooftops for a long time now, telling
people that during phase one, that first
12 months, there is no prohibition on
CMC level two status being a
requirement. It's totally up to DoD's
discretion when it comes to making
radiation hardened micro electronics for
300 millimeter wafer production
fabrication capabilities. Level two it
is. So, we'll include the link to uh
that RFI and you guys can check it out
for yourself. Next up, there's one from
Special Operations Command, US SOCOM.
They have a notice on there for global
services delivery sources sought. This
is for administrative management,
general management, consulting services.
So, very, very different from making
precision radiation hardened micro
electronics. They're actually updating a
notice that they put on SAM.gov prior to
the 48 CFR CMMC rule being published.
They say this update is provided to
place offerers on notice that the final
CMMC rule was released on 10 September
2025 based on the implementation date of
10 November 2025 and an anticipated
request for proposal release date that
falls after that implementation date.
The government will include a CMC pass
fail requirement in the final RFP as
qualifying criteria. They say it's
currently anticipated that CMC level one
will be required at the time of proposal
uh submission. Potent potential offerers
are encouraged to begin working to meet
this requirement if you have not already
done so. They go on to say prime
offerers are encouraged to ensure that
team members, so they're subcontractors,
team members have also completed this
requirement as a prime offerer will be
disqualified if it is determined that an
identified team member does not also
meet CMMC level one qualification. So
they want administrative support,
consulting support, general management
consulting services. So not super high
speed, not doing consulting in space,
right? This is not ITAR rated whatever.
It's just sort of general support
services, but it's a contract after the
effective date. So, it's going to have
at least CMMC level one. So, some people
think that's easy. That's no big deal. A
lot of people think that that's a bridge
too far. Here you go. If you're trying
to do uh administrative management and
general management consulting services
for US special operations command next
year, then uh you're going to have to be
able to prove that you have at least CMC
level one and your subs have at least
CMMC level one.
>> Yeah, that was the thing that stood out
to me the most. Uh this wasn't one where
the level uh exceeded what was supposed
to be uh uh supposed to take place,
right? We didn't go past level one self-
assessment and what we expected, what
people's expectations were. But what we
did say is that your entire supply chain
has to be in order and if it's not in
order, uh you're not going to get
awarded this contract. You'll just be
disqualified.
>> Absolutely. So we had the Navy, we had
US SOCOM, now we have US Army Corps of
Engineers, and there's a ton of stuff
from the Army Corps of Engineers uh that
has uh mentions of CMMC requirements in
it. They're probably the ones that have,
you know, they're the most in front of
this requirement for the current set of
things that are on SAM.gov. So under the
core of engineers for commercial and
institutional building construction,
they want uh people to uh uh solicit
offers for the construction of
groundbased strategic deterrent sentinel
operations group facilities at few air
force base in Wyoming. So GBSD, this is
America's intercontinental ballistic
missile system. So they're building
buildings around intercontinental
ballistic missiles, which is kind of a
big deal. So they say in this notice the
project is anticipated to be subject to
cyber security maturity model
certification level two pursuant to def
clause 7021.
Firms will need to ensure they are
properly certified. Failure to meet the
CMMC level two requirement will make an
offerer ineligible for award. They'd
anticipate that the award will happen in
FY27.
So, you have a ton of time before
they're going to award this contract.
You are going to be making buildings
that go around intercontinental
ballistic missiles at a strategic air
force base in Wyoming. You know, like in
Terminator when like the the the prairie
opens up and the giant missiles fly out
of the ground, that's what you're making
buildings around. So, you're going to
probably need CMMC level two at a
minimum, although that even seems a
little loose to me. It ain't going to be
level one, and it probably won't be a
self assessment for obvious reasons. But
we're talking about construction
companies here, right? We're not talking
about, you know, some high-speed
space-based laser uh micro electronic
whatever, right? But you're in and
around these facilities. You're dealing
with whatever the data is that they're
talking about here. In this uh notice on
SAM.gov, They say, "Please include the
following information in your response
narrative. Briefly describe your firm's
current status regarding CMMC progress."
Remember, this isn't until FY27. We're
talking about, you know, basically a
year from now, October of uh 2026.
Briefly describe your firm's current
status regarding the CMMC process. This
includes but is not limited to whether
you are actively working towards
certification at a specific level or
have already achieved CMMC
certification. If you are certified,
please indicate the achieved level. So a
year before they plan to award it,
they're like where are you on your
progress? Are you progressing or do you
already have your C? And I would imagine
that if you put down we already got our
cert that that's going to be a huge
help.
I don't know a year is a long time so
maybe other people are going to get
their certs and they'll be able to say
yeah we're working on it. We'll let you
know. But they're telling you right now
a year from now level two.
>> Well yeah so let's talk about what
stands out here. Everybody always
applies CMMC requirements uh
automatically to I make a part for a
missile. I make this special chip that
goes into this. I I make this that goes
into this particular name your defense
capability here, right? And then we're
like, well, what about some of those
like not directly impacted contracts?
Are we going to see this pop into this
construction one? Is one people don't
realize the importance of protecting
maybe the blueprints for the buildings
that surround those silos, protecting
some of the capabilities of those
buildings, and that's why these
requirements go into it. Um, do you
think, and this is just a strict
question to you, do you think because
it's a construction based one and
they're going to have to submit like
design drawings, architecture drawings,
and all that to be bid on and approved
on, right? Uh, they're going to have to
accept not only the contractor's uh,
proposal, but what the contractor's
design is, right? So maybe because the
narrative's there, they have to have all
that in place because it's such a longer
process.
>> Yeah. I don't know. I mean, the uh, you
know, that reading through the SAM.gov,
of, you know, notice on there. There's
tons of stuff in there that are specific
to the construction industry and the
types of buildings and the types of like
reinforced concrete footings that they
have to make. You there's a lot of
situational stuff that I'm sure can
drive those requirements. But the thing
>> that's what I did a terrible job of
trying to ask the question for is like
are there situational things as to why
we're seeing this pop out because the
anticipated award is 27 or is this just
these the Army Corps of Engineers being
way ahead of it is kind of what
>> it's hard to know. I mean, I'm sure that
a lot of for a lot of these big
expensive construction projects, some of
these construction projects are like,
you know, they're they're basically
saying like, don't even don't even talk
to us if you can't support like a $175
million project or larger. And they
think that it's going to be in the
neighborhood of like$1 175 mil to $250
million project over the course of
like,00 days, right? So, they're pretty
certain like the scale of these things.
But yeah, that's the part that jumped
out to me was they're not saying that
you don't need a level two cert until
FY27 because of the phased rollout.
They're saying you need a level two in
FY27 because that's when we're going to
award the contract, right? So if they
were going to say we're going to award
this in Q4 of 2026, phase roll out is
not what's driving this requirement.
Just happens to be that's when the award
period is going to be. They aren't
saying in the interim you can do a self
assessment. There's no work until they
award the contract. So the phase roll
out is not what's driving, hey, you
don't need this for a year. It's the
contract award, anticipated contract
award date.
>> Yep.
>> Yeah. All righty. So, we talked about
the Navy. We talked about SOCOM. We
talked about Army Corps of Engineers.
Army Corps of Engineers has several
other notices on SAM.gov currently,
including housing revitalization
projects in Yakusa, Japan. So, base
housing. Uh, anybody who's lived in base
housing knows they're constantly in need
of renovation. Uh, they have a multiple
award task order contract in Honshu,
Japan. They have a bulk fuel storage
tanks phase 2 opportunity at Yakakota
Air Base in Japan. So, you're talking
roofers. You're talking just a multiple
award contract. You're talking bulk fuel
storage specialty construction.
Everything from micro electronics to
roofing to building concrete footings
for missiles. Like there's all kinds of
stuff that is on SAM.gov all the time.
But the overall thing that the Army
Corps of Engineers put into each of
these is they've said the Army Corps of
Engineers Japan District anticipates
that all solicitations issued on or
after November 10th will require CMMC
level one certification or higher.
Period. Right. say if your company is
not certified at level one or higher,
you will not be eligible to receive a
contract award. They have related
questions in all of these notices on
SAM.gov. One of them on there says,
"Does your company have CMMC
certification? If yes, what level and
when does it expire?" They say, "The
government is seeking to minimize
proposed variations or substitutions
during the solicitation bidder inquiry
period." bad news for everybody that
says, "We're just going to ask for
special treatment. We're just going to
ask for a waiver. We're just going to
ask for this to not be a problem." They
say, "We're seeking to minimize all of
the nonsense during the bidder inquiry
period due to strict timelines. Our
ability to fully analyze these requests
during the solicitation phase is often
limited. We've said this multiple times,
right? the the the cardinal sin of
running a business is being difficult to
do business with. And so the government
is saying you're going to need this
certification if you want an award.
Period. Please tell us if you have the
cert and when it expires. We don't want
to spend time going back and forth with
people over this requirement. There's
many other things that they list as
well, but this is relevant to the
podcast. So if you got the C, you can
say, "Yep, we got it. doesn't expire for
two years, doesn't expire for three
years, doesn't expire for whatever, and
they don't have to sit there and give
you special treatment for it. They don't
have to carve out time for it. It's just
one more thing that isn't going to be a
discriminator against being able to do
work with them. And that's for all Army
Corps of Engineer offerings for the
entire Japan district.
>> Now, if level one is the requirement,
obviously, uh you shouldn't be trying to
get variations or substitutions or
waiverss or anything like that, right?
Because of the simplicity of it. Um, but
if level two is your requirement and
you're trying to get that there, there's
just not time to do that and if you're
depending on that trying to compensate
for the fact that you didn't get the
waiver and make up for it to get done in
time, it's just not enough time,
especially if they're trying to move
faster.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, some other Army Corps of
Engineers notices that we've seen on
SAM.gov, and this is all since September
10th, right? So, this is all stuff
that's happened in the last handful of
weeks when there really hasn't been a
lot of activity on SAM.gov because of
the shutdown. So other things that we've
seen, semiconductor test labs at Whitand
Missile Range in New Mexico, probably
going to be at least level two based off
of just the title of what they're
talking about. The John Day Dam turbine
runner replacement and generator project
in Rufus, Oregon. So we're talking about
hydroelectrics. We're talking about
micro electronics, roofing, bulk fuel
storage, general admin support.
everything that the DoD is doing, you're
going to have a CMMC level one
requirement in it at least starting on
November 10th. And for some of these,
you're going to have CMMC level two
status requirements. The phased roll out
doesn't matter, right? It is not a
prohibition on including it. The problem
that I see is that these are all the
things that have sort of snuck through
for whatever reason. they're allowable
or they're priority. But, you know,
we're into the next fiscal year now and
we haven't seen the long range
acquisition forecasts get posted by the
various DoD components. So, I think
what's going to happen is once the
government opens back up, there's going
to be a huge rush to try to get these
uh, you know, RFPs, RFIs, solicitations
out there onto SAM.gov. And it's going
to be even more constrained like the
Army Corps of Engineers said where
they're like we're way behind schedule.
do you have it or do you not have it?
And so you'll have even less time to
anticipate what's going to be in those
uh contract solicitations because
instead of them coming out in the last
couple weeks, they might not come out
for another month or two depending on
how long things take,
>> but they'll still have the same deadline
to get
>> still going to have the same deadline.
>> Yeah, I I didn't even think about that.
That's such a great point. Like the
shutdown because they can't work and the
contracts don't get out, they still have
to get fulfilled and there's still
projects that have to get done. Yeah, if
they were planning on, you know,
publishing something in October or
November to award it in January or
February, and you don't see it until
December, right, then you have way less
time in order to do the same thing that
they were going to require all the time
anyway. So, for everybody out there that
says, "We're going to wait until we see
it in a solicitation to believe that
it's real." Here's a couple of examples
from different components, different
industries, different levels, different
stuff. You're going to see the
requirement in this solicitation. Like,
don't don't be fooled. We're what 20
days, a little less than 20 days. We're
getting into the, you know, we're
getting close to single digits here from
the start of the phase roll out.
>> That's crazy.
>> So, you know, the phase rollout's going
to go live and the government might not
be open. So, everybody's going to be
like looking around waiting for things
to happen and then as soon as these
solicitations come out, then it's going
to be in there. So, I thought it was
interesting to walk through and see that
we're, you know, already seeing very
clear-cut examples of CMC requirements.
We'll include all the links to the ones
that we mentioned in sam.gov and uh
we'll go from there.
>> See you next week folks.
>> See you next week everybody.
