## Transcript

Alrighty, folks. It is February of 2026,
and this one is a doozy. As of February
1st, 2026, defense contractors will no
longer be required to conduct basic
selfassessments
and upload their scores into SPS
pursuant to DAR's provision 252204719
and DAR's clause 252204720.
In fact, 7019 and 7020 no longer exist
at all. Thanks to a defar class
deviation, you will now see DEFARS
clause 2522407997
called NIST SP8001 171 DoD assessment
requirements. No, that is not a joke.
That is real. Oh, and on top of that,
you won't see FAR clause 5220421
anymore either because it has a new
number 5224093.
Oh, and all of this happened without any
rule making at all yet. So, what the
hell is going on? Well, strap in, grab
your coffee, because that's what we're
going to talk about this week.
Jason, this is the biggest change to
DEFAR's cyber security contract clauses
outside of CMMC since 2020. And as far
as I can tell, nobody's talking about
this yet. Uh, initial thoughts before we
uh journey into the center of the earth
here.
>> Jacob, the the late great professional
wrestler Rody Roddy Piper used to always
say, one of the best on the mic ever,
right? used to always say just when they
think they know the answers I change it
up and switch the questions, right? And
so like this is what's what's happening
right here in front of our eyes. Just
when the defense industrial base thinks
that they're just scratching the surface
on the answers, surprise, the questions
are changed. When you were telling me
the background and you said February
1st, I thought you were extremely
confused because April 1st is April
Fool's Day, not February 1st. And I
thought this was all a joke.
>> Hey, what is happening, dude?
>> Yeah. Yeah. The a lot of times the
changes the the people who lament the
changes around CMMC, they tend to
overblow what those changes actually
are. Not this time. These are actually
legitimate changes that are going to
cause
>> This is a big deal, bro.
>> Yeah. Uh Yeah. Okay. So, real quick,
against my instincts to explain
everything and then get to the changes,
we're going to summarize the changes
first. That way, you can listen to the
context if you want to. So, five things
to know here. First, FAR clause 5220421
has been renumbered to 5224093.
It is still titled basic safeguarding of
covered contractor information systems.
The 15 requirements are still the same.
They have not changed. The flow down is
still the same. Still applies to systems
that handle federal contract
information. All that stuff is the same,
but it has a new number 5224093.
That is real. So if you see the new
number, that is not an error. Second,
DAR's provision 252204719
no longer exists. It has been deleted.
Third, def clause 2522047020
has two changes to it. It has been
renumbered to 2522 2407997.
It is still titled NIS SP8001 171 DoD
assessment requirements. However, there
is no longer a basic selfassessment
requirement that has been completely
deleted from the text of the clause.
medium and high assessments and
everything associated with that process
remain unchanged but everything related
to basic self assessments and uploading
your score to SPS uh has now gone away.
Fourth, there are no changes to DAR's
clause 2522047012
or provision 252204708.
And fifth, there are no changes to
DEFAR's clause 252204721,
the CMMC clause or its provision
252204725.
Initial thoughts here, Jason?
>> Yeah. So, I guess uh everything between
7025 and 797 was taken. So, we just
decided to throw something at the dart
board. And this
>> honestly, man, I love rulemaking. I love
this whole process. I have no idea why
they picked that number. I I have no
idea.
>> I feel like for continuity and
understanding of of applicability,
right? Like I I can reference 21. I can
reference 25. I used to until today. RIP
reference 19 and 20 and know kind of
what they apply to. Uh obviously with
familiarity and time, people are going
to relate 79.997 to uh DoD assessment
requirements. It's just that it's not
the immediate. It doesn't trigger it,
right? like it's not
>> we went from yeah we went from two
things to one thing but we went from two
similar numbers to a very different
number from the rest you know maybe they
fell asleep on the keyboard but
ultimately yeah it's 247997
>> and then the second thing is that like
I've been doing this show with you long
enough and we speak enough uh that I've
heard the words overhaul uh six billion
times right and what I see here
potentially it and you're going probably
let me know is maybe the the beginning
rumblings of the overhaul and what we
see the outset of it.
>> Yeah. So, okay everybody, let's talk
about why this is happening. So, we
talked about what happened. Let's talk
about why it's happening. Here is the
bigger context around those changes. So
for the last 40 years, the Federal
Acquisition Regulation or the FAR has
been the rule book for how the
government buys stuff and how they
conduct business. It's the primary
regulation used by all agencies in the
acquisition of supplies and services
with appropriated funds for those
agencies. The FAR is codified at chapter
one of title 48 of the code of federal
regulations. That's what we're referring
to when we refer to the FAR. It's issued
jointly by GSA, NASA, and the DoD who
are often referred to as the FAR
Council. It is uh it also includes
standard solicitation provisions and
contract clauses and various agency
supplements such as the DFARS, the
defense FAR supplement or the uh
Department of Homeland Security
supplement, the HSAR, the Health and
Human Services supplement, the HHR, I
believe it there's one for every agency.
There's a supplement for every one of
them. So you have the FAR and then all
the supplements, the one that we're
really referring to most of the time is
the DFAR, the DoD supplement to the FAR.
This is why the full title of a clause
like DAR 712 is 48 CFR252.204712.
Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations,
the DoD supplement to the FAR at 252 and
then the address after that. Overall,
the FAR and the agency supplements are
thousands and thousands of pages long
and they get longer every year and
that's kind of a big problem and it's
been a big problem for 40 years since
the FAR was created and that brings up
the idea like you mentioned Jason of
what's known as the revolutionary FAR
overhaul. So, in August of 2025, the
Office of Federal Procurement Policy
launched a massive
deregulation effort known as the
revolutionary FAR overhaul. This is the
first major overhaul and the largest
single update to the FAR in its 40-year
history. This is a massive, massive
undertaking. So their goal is to rewrite
the FAR in quote unquote plain language
and remove most text that isn't either
required by statute, required by
executive order, or according to them
essential to sound procurement. In
total, the RFO, the revolutionary FAR
overhaul, hopes to eliminate up to a
third of the FAR in its entirety. Just
slash and burn all this stuff that's
ended up in this massive regulation. if
it doesn't absolutely need to be there.
The policy basis for this effort goes
all the way to the top. This is not some
random thing that the FAR council
thought up. It's based on three things.
One, executive order 14275,
restoring common sense to federal
procurement. Executive order 14265,
modernizing defense acquisitions and
spurring innovation in the defense
industrial base. and three OM memorandum
M2526
overhauling federal acquisition
regulation. Since August, every single
part of the FAR has gone under the
microscope. And you can see the changes
to every subp part, every section, every
subsection, every line on the RFO
website. Trust me, I have looked. We
will link to it below if you're curious.
Uh it's part of this these changes that
we're talking about today that affect
defense contractors are one small echo
of a massive massive policy change uh
for the overall FAR in its entirety.
>> First and foremost, executive order
14275 restoring common sense to federal
procurement has now easily ascended to
the top of my list as best named
executive orders of all time. Right. Uh
like anything where you're throwing
common sense in there, I like the way
that it's looking. Jacob, everything
that you're saying I 40year uh you know
far regulations obviously 40 years ago
40 year ago prices aren't the same as
today's prices as the kids would like to
say today right so like there's changes
that have to be made it's just that
again I've been with you long enough
we've talked long enough I think I've
learned enough from you that I even if
they're keeping track of every changes
to every subp part of every section some
of those changes have to go through a
process right a rulemaking process So
why?
>> Yeah. So yeah, so I think on a high
level, everybody would agree this is a
good policy, right? There's a lot of
stuff. Just like when if you ever tried
to move after you've lived in one place
for a long time, you just end up with a
lot of stuff. You're like, where did all
this stuff come from? We don't need all
this stuff. Same thing with the FAR.
We've been in one place for 40 years.
There's definitely some stuff in there
that doesn't need to be in there. Get
rid of it. Right. Uh okay. Like he
mentioned, our astute audience that has
been listening for a while is probably
asking themselves, "Okay, hold on. How
are they changing regulations without
going through the pain of rulemaking,
the process of creating and changing
regulations?" Like you're talking about
changing a all of the regulations and
you're not doing any rule making
whatsoever. The answer is class
deviations.
A class deviation is a formal temporary
authorization that allows federal
agencies to bypass, alter, or ignore
parts of the FAR or the agency
supplements like the DFARS. They're
typically issued uh to implement new
policies, to implement legislative
changes, or to meet urgent requirements
across multiple solicitations and
contracts. across an entire class,
right? Multiple solicitations in
contracts. There might be individual
deviations in an individual negotiation.
We're talking about policy for entire
classes, right? Class deviations
instruct the contracting officers to
omit, replace, or insert specific clause
language in place of what might already
be codified in title 48 of the FAR or
the agency supplements. and they remain
in effect until they are rescended or
until that text is officially
incorporated via the very slow and
painful process of rulemaking. If people
have been listening to the podcast for a
while, you might recall two examples of
class deviations that are relevant to
defense contractors. First is class
deviation 2025-00006
rolls right off the tongue. the use of
the clause on contractor compliance with
CMMC level requirements. Remember the
original 2020 CMMC rule said to insert
the 7021 clause in all solicitations and
contracts starting on October 1st of
2025. The problem was that CMMC 2.0
rulemaking that was going to change that
clause wouldn't go into effect until
after October of 2025. So contracting
officers were going to be inserting the
wrong text of the wrong clause and that
was going to be a big issue. So in
August of 2025, the DoD issued a
deviation that said contracting officers
shall not use the 7021 clause until the
effective date of the CMMC final rule,
which ended up being November 10th of
2025. We did a whole episode about it.
You can check it out in the link below.
Another example, class deviation
20240013.
This was the one that addressed the
DAR712 issue. So the original text of
DAR712 from 2016 says to implement the
most current version of NIS SP8001 171
at the time of solicitation. As of
today, that would be 171 revision 3. But
CMMC is pinned to a specific version of
171 as of today. That would be 171
revision 2. That's a big problem that
they didn't foresee being an issue back
in 2016 when they revised the text of
DAR 712. So the DoD issued a class
deviation in May of 2024 that said
ignore the text of 7012 at title 48 of
the code of federal regulations and use
this text instead. And that's why
everybody is being directed to implement
171 rev 2 in your uh in your contracts
and your solicitations. Even though if
you Google 7012, that's not what it
actually says at Title 48 because it
hasn't gone through rulemaking to update
Title 48. We're using the class
deviation in its place. This is why we
called that podcast episode crisis
averted. Uh check it out in the link
below if you don't remember it.
>> Jacob, so uh what I'm seeing here, and I
maybe this isn't the right time to ask
you this in the episode, right? But what
I'm seeing here, especially with these
two class deviations being issued, it's
kind of like they were uh foreseeing
potential hiccups in the program roll
out or in potential compliance that
needed to be alleviated. Right? In one
case, it was a new revision of NIST 800
171 was coming out. There could be some
confusion with requirements for CMC
program, etc. In the other case, it was
the inclusion of a clause that was
outdated with outdated language. the
things that we've seen updated here,
Jacob, right?
What are they what is this a precursor
for? What are we preparing for? What
what are we trying to avoid here?
>> Yeah. So, it doesn't necessarily avoid a
problem as much as it avoids the problem
of how long rulemaking takes, right? So
they're issuing class deviations for
every single part of the FAR and for all
agency supplements so that the agencies
can use that updated leaner language.
Right now the agencies don't have to
wait for the rulemaking for every
chapter of the FAR to be finalized for
them to be able to use the leaner meaner
uh whatever whatever pro wrestling
reference we're going to use uh text
that they want to use. Right? So, so
imagine class deviations for every
single part of the FAR before those go
through rulemaking. Agencies can take
that class deviation language and they
can implement it right now. So that's
what people are going to see. That's
very helpful for going fast. But
remember this is an important point. If
you Google def 712, you will see the
text of the language that's at title 48
that says to use the most current
version of NIST SP8001 171. There is a
class deviation that doesn't show up
when you Google it that says you need to
use this version of DAR 712 that says to
implement NIST SP8001 171 Rev 2. So if
you Google any part of the FAR, any part
of the DFARS right now, you're going to
see the part that last went through
rulemaking. But there is now an entire
library, literally dozens and dozens,
hundreds of class deviations that change
the text of the FAR, the DARS, the HSAR
that will start showing up in
solicitations and contracts. This is
part of the reason why I think nobody's
been talking about this yet because 7997
isn't something that you can Google
because it hasn't gone through
rulemaking. It's just on a random PDF
buried on a DoD acquisition website
somewhere.
>> I I thought you were testing me. I'm not
so we'll be fully transparent here. I I
Googled it when you were like this is
we're going to talk about on the show
this week. I Googled it and I was like
hey nothing's coming up. I think the
guys officially lost it. you know, I'm
reach I'm reaching out to make sure we
have the resources available to you in
case we've gone, you know, officially
rule making has pushed you. Uh, no, but
so what you're saying is that these
changes, you have to know where to look
for these changes, right? Like it's a
spec it's a specified
skill. I'm not trying to hype you up,
but like to the average person, me,
raise his hand. You just can't Google
this and find it. You have to
>> look. Not yet. Not yet. So these changes
are going to show up in people's
solicitations and contracts, but you
won't actually be able to Google them,
right? Which is why expect after this
podcast people are going to be like I
don't know what the heck you're talking
about I can't find what you're talking
about you can still find FAR 522421
you can still find DAR 719 and 7020
online even though the deviation text
has changed as of February 1st and
people will see 7997 in their contracts
and solicitations instead and I'm sure
there's going to be issues where people
still have 719 show up even though it
should be 7997 just be aware that it's
not a typo this is actually the way that
things are going to be changing.
>> Could we possibly see a a class
deviation that says do not use 7019 or
or or some sort of you know what I mean?
>> Well, the class deviation right now
there is no 7019. Like there is no text
to use, right? Yeah. So there there's no
instruction to insert it because it
doesn't exist. But anyways, just to wrap
up this section, eventually all of these
changes, all of the changes to the FAR,
all of the changes to the DARS and so on
will go through rulemaking. They're
probably gonna go through rulemaking all
at once as a gigantic omnibus shoving
the entire FAR revision through rule
making. [laughter]
>> It's gonna be
>> Super Bowl.
>> It's going to be the the Super Bowl. I
can't I am for you.
>> I'm giddy with anticipation, but the
mountain of changes are being published
as class deviations first to enable
agencies to quote begin using the
streamlined FAR part until the FAR is
revised through the formal rulemaking
process.
>> We don't know what happened to them, but
the entire FAR omnibus was [laughter]
making.
>> We haven't seen them in weeks.
>> We never saw him again.
>> Okay, so let's get down to specifics.
Let's talk FAR 5220421.
So, we're overhauling the FAR and that
includes the humble uh unassuming clause
5220421,
basic safeguarding for covered
contractor information systems. Since
2016, this clause has imposed 15 cyber
security requirements on federal
contractors when the contractor or their
subcontractor at any tier handles
federal contract information. Thanks to
the overhaul of FAR part 52, 5220421.
Thanks to the overhaul of FAR part 52
which is solicitations and contract
clauses, the clause is reumbered to
52240-93.
Same title, same text, same
requirements, different number. CMMC
level one assesses those requirements.
So that's still the same, but we're
going to see CMMC referencing a clause
number that no longer exists, everybody.
So
>> not confusing at all.
>> So CMC is going to reference 5220421
even though that clause is now titled
5224093.
Even though when you Google it, it's
still going to come up as 5220421.
And the references won't be normalized
until rulemaking is complete for the FAR
overhaul and for CMMC 3.0, which I'm
sure means we're going to have to juggle
this issue for probably another two
years. I so
just thought about something that just
came to me. I know
the entire first day of any CCP class
that like this is the entire first day
is gone,
>> right?
>> Like you're you're Hi, I I I know I
don't want to sound crazy, right? I'm
your instructor here. I'm going to tell
you about these three ghost clauses that
used to apply to the program that no
longer apply to the program, but still
technically apply to the program. We're
going to figure it all out together. And
because I have a code of professional
conduct with a year or two, I have to
operate and teach with what was it
proper use of methods. Right? So these
changes are the things that I have to
live by and I have to execute by.
However, I have to teach by the approved
training materials which now include
three dead clauses.
>> That's right. That's right. Yeah. So I
hopefully at the beginning of
>> No problems. We're not [laughter] going
to run into any issues here.
>> Not confusing at all. No big deal.
>> Okay. That's just that's just changing
the number. They didn't actually change
the text of anything. So, let's talk
about the defars.
>> Setting yourself up for success is just
>> Yeah, absolutely. This is this is this
is the definition of left-handism,
right? So, that brings us to the DFARS.
So, on February 1st of 2026, 38
different defiations
went into effect to match overall FAR
deviation. 38 of them. [laughter]
makes [clears throat] sense.
>> The one little corner of the world that
we're concerned about are the cyber
security clauses. There's a remember
there's a big old thing that's happening
in terms of FAR overhaul that affects
all of the stuff out there in the FAR,
but we're concerned of just this one
little corner. So, DAR's provision
252204719
does not exist anymore as of February
1st, 2026. It has been deleted. Defar's
clause 252204720
has two big changes. First, it has been
reumbered
to 252247997.
[snorts] It has still got the same title
NIST SP8171 DoD assessment requirements,
but it has a new number 240-7997.
Second, there is no longer a basic
selfassessment requirement. All
>> that's the victory here. That is the
victory here. We're going to take the
positives out of this situation.
>> You know, sometimes you got to take the
good with the bad. Honestly, I think
this overall is worth it. There is no
longer a basic self- assessment
requirement. All references to basic
self- assessments have been removed.
That means that the requirement to
upload a basic self assessment into SPRS
have also been removed. All other parts
of the clause are the same. High and
medium assessments are still conducted
by DICAC using NIS SP800171
alpha. Assessment scores will be
uploaded to SPSS by Dc. Uh those
assessments apply to covered contractor
information systems that are required to
comply with DAR's clause 252204712
which has not changed at all.
Hallelujah. Thank God they didn't change
that one. Contractors still have 14 days
for assessment rebuttals. The clause
still flows down to contractors. All the
stuff that we covered in our DAR cyber
security back to basics series which is
now out of date and needs to be
re-recorded thanks to the new numbering.
Thanks a lot for our council.
>> Actually, no. Thank you. Thank you. Like
for
>> all of that stuff is still the same. If
you're curious, need to catch up, you
can uh now check those out. We will add
the link below. So what's going on here?
People still have the requirement to
implement NIS SP800171 pursuant to
DFR712, but they don't have to conduct a
self- assessment and upload the score to
SPSS. No, because now a bunch of the
text of 7997 says you're going to use
the scoring methodology that's at the
CMMC regulation 32 CFR 170. is now as of
November 10th of 2025, all DoD contracts
and solicitations that include CUI that
would trigger the requirements in DAR
712 have at least CMMC level 2
selfassessment requirements. So, we're
removing a piece of redundancy. The 7019
7020 basic assessment versus the CMMC
level two self assessment and thirdparty
assessment. That's a win. We changed the
number and we deleted some stuff and we
were gonna have to juggle things for a
while because rulemaking is lagging
behind class deviations and blah blah
blah. But ultimately instead of having a
basic self- assessment score upload and
a CMC level two self- assessment score
upload, you now only have CMMC score
uploads when that applies to you.
>> Yeah. And I again we take this as a win
because there was a lot of confusion
around that. Do I submit the SPRS for
this? Do I submit the SPRS for that? to
us. But this level two, do I need to
verify all of that thing? So this
>> as crazy as it is, um it it obviously is
a positive benefit to the entire
program, right? And and so the timing,
as much as we're like, hey, not talking
to the right, realistically, it's a roll
down because this is far, it's going
from far up above, right? And then it
trickles down to the individual agencies
as they choose to enforce.
>> Exactly. Exactly.
>> Yeah.
>> So just to just to remind everybody,
what about Dar 712? There are no changes
to def clause 252204712
If you'd like a review about what is
involved with those, check out our back
to basics series that we'll link down
below. What about CMMC? There are no
changes to def clause 252204721
or its provision 2522047025.
Those are still the same as they have
always been. You can check out the link
to our webinar from the final rule as
well as some of the other podcasts that
we've done covering those clauses.
Jason, what are your thoughts here
before we get to takeaways?
>> I two questions for you. Uh do you think
this is a any sort of smoke signal that
indicates uh maybe some farce UI in the
near future, right? Because these are
things or elements that are attached to
it. I think that that's the first
question that I obviously have to you.
And then the second thing that I have to
you is I think this was one of our these
changes 7019 going away obviously wasn't
one of those things we predicted in our
you know year end.
>> No that was not
but I I do think this kind of counts as
our our FAR overhaul right like we we
said that this was coming.
>> Yeah. Yeah. It's close enough for me.
>> Yeah. I'll take I'll take it. Yeah.
>> Yeah. So so the FARCUI rule FARCUI rule
has been the white whale of the CUI
program for 10 years now. and we saw the
proposed rule come out finally in
January of 2025. We've been waiting on
the final rule. I think that this is
what has been holding up the final rule
is that the FAR in its entirety is being
overhauled all at once. So, I think
we're going to see the FARC cui rule
text come out when the entire FAR
overhaul goes through rulemaking all at
once. I think they're going to stick it
in there and that's what we're going to
be looking for when that semi truck of
rulemaking uh bashes through the wall
all at once. Uh I hope so. I mean, if if
there was anything that was still
holding it up, this seems like a good
thing that would be doing that. Uh and
it wouldn't necessarily be holding it up
as much as they aren't going to be
changing the text of the FAR in the
middle of an overhaul. I think they're
just going to push it all together at
once. Cross your fingers. I really hope
that all happens.
>> Yeah, I thanks for the answer. I I I I
figured like as we were going through
it, I figured that this is it. This is
these are indicators that we're getting
close to that
>> white.
You know, they announced this thing back
in August of last year and then we
started to see the draft of the
deviations in December of last year. We
didn't really talk about it or bring it
up because honestly in the back of my
mind I was like there's no way. There's
no way that they're going to be able to
overhaul the FAR all at once and they're
doing it. Like to their credit they are
actually overhauling, you know, I mean
you're talking about like oh let's go
through and proofread all of Tolken's
books. It's like it is a humongous
project and they're actually doing it.
So I I honestly didn't think that they
were going to get this far. Uh, you
know, there was a lot of big talk, uh,
last year about all kinds of fun things
that were going to happen that never
really came to fruition. And, uh, this
one actually seems to be the thing where
they walked the walk. Um,
>> I would say this is a fun thing
happening.
>> Yeah,
>> I would say I would safely classify this
as a fun thing.
>> Fun.
>> Absolutely. Couple takeaways.
Ultimately, this is a win. It's going to
be very annoying to juggle the different
clause numbers and the deviations and
the rule making and this and that. Uh,
but ultimately, it's a win. You have one
clause to deal with instead of 7019 and
7020. You no longer have two basic
assessments to deal with. You only have
the one under CMMC. I think that's the
right move. I think it removes
redundancy. I don't really like how they
numbered it, but I can live with that.
>> Yeah, it's not a 56 to nothing blowout
victory as it would have been if it was
timed before the rule went final so
there was extra confusion. But we'll
we'll do 3127 in overtime. It's still a
W is a W, right? It still goes in the
same column. And at the end of the day,
in the long run, the program will be
better for it.
>> Yeah. And I guess my last takeaway, I'm
a little disappointed in the CMC haters.
I think they're losing a step because
they have not passed up an opportunity
to misconstrue
things about rulemaking that they
clearly do not understand into things
that they would tell people all day long
were surely going to kill CMMC and DAR
cyber security requirements. They did it
with the last two class deviations and
they were completely wrong about that.
Here they're talking about slashing,
reforming, cutting the FAR by a third,
getting rid of redundancies, spurring
innovation, the defense industrial base.
That's exactly the kind of material that
the CMMC flatearthers out there would
have jumped all over in the past and
said, "See, they're going to kill CMMC."
Last takeaway here, clearly the cyber
security requirements are essential to
procurement. Not only are they statutory
requirements, not only are they
executive order requirements, they are
also essential to procurement. If there
was ever an opportunity where they were
going to kind of cut some things that
people really didn't want, this was
going to be it. And that is not what
happened. They renumbered it. They made
it more efficient. We still have the
same requirements. It ain't going
anywhere. If
>> if they're trying to get rid of it and
get and kill it off, right? Why are they
killing off the DoD counterparts to it
that existed before it that accomplished
the same things in lie of that? Right?
Like I
>> if you wanted to kill it, this is how
you would have done it and they didn't.
>> Thanks for the engagement. Just keep it.
>> Yeah. See you next time. Next next time
there's a reform maybe then, but not
this time. All right, everybody. Did you
have fun, kids? Uh that was a long tour
through a bunch of very obscure rule
making and class deviations. I hope it
was clear. If you have questions, let us
know. This won't be the last time that
we talk about it. Uh, make sure that you
like and subscribe and uh, we'll see you
next week.
>> Def's overhaul videos incoming. [snorts]
See you next [laughter] week.
