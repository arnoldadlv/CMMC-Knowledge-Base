## Transcript

All right, folks. A lot of defense
contractors are waiting to start on CMMC
compliance until they see the
requirement in a solicitation. The
problem is that successful CMMC status
is a condition of contract award. No
status, no contract. If you have tons of
time between solicitation and award,
wonderful. But if you only have a few
months between solicitation and award,
waiting until solicitation is a great
way to lose business. So, how long do
defense contractors have to achieve
CMMC? And when are these solicitations
and awards actually happening? That's
what we're going to talk about today.
[music]
Jason, we're gonna change up this format
a little bit. We give the people what
they want and we're talking about the
bottom line. We're talking about the
takeaways. At the start, we looked at
all 1,070
contract opportunities that the Naval
Air Systems Command anticipates over the
next 12 to 24 months. Defense
contractors supporting naval air systems
programs will have on average only about
nine months to prep for CMMC level two
if they wait until they see the
requirement in a new solicitation. That
is not a lot of time for the average
contractor out there. Some fun facts
that we're going to get into the details
on. The smaller the contract, the less
time you have to prepare. 35% of
opportunities are anticipated to have an
award window of six months or less. 30%
of NAVA air solicitations are
anticipated in Q2 of 2026, which is
right around the corner. And 32% of
their contract awards are anticipated in
Q2 of 2026, which means they already put
out the solicitation. So, if you haven't
started, you are very far behind.
Initial thoughts on those uh those
takeaways there. The great and powerful
Macho Man Randy Savage once said, "The
cream always rises to the top, Jacob."
And right now what I'm getting to see
because I get to speak to a lot of DIB
organizations especially lately I is
that the cream is rising to the top and
people are taking this seriously and
that cream is the people that are going
to be able to win awards because the
rest of the people that aren't
necessarily the cream are having these
conversations like I haven't seen
anything to make me motivated enough to
do this or I think that I could do this
in enough time or I really need your
help because I scheduled my C3 3 PAO to
come in 10 days.
>> Yeah. So, I mean, we've seen it
anecdotally. You've seen it on your
calls. I've seen it on my calls.
Daniel's seen it on his calls. Everybody
knows it. We've done whole episodes on
analysis that the DoD has done on their
own that shows that systemically DI
contractors overestimate their readiness
for CMMC to a massive degree. It's
always been that way. Doesn't seem to
change. So, that begs the question, how
much time do you actually have to
prepare? Because you've probably
underestimated that amount of time you
have a mismatch. How are we going to be
able to tell what's going on? You don't
have to take our word for it. We're not
trying to sell you on what we think the
timeline should be. You need to find out
about procurement administrative lead
time. All right. What the heck is that?
PLT procurement administrative lead
time. This is an official metric that is
required uh that the the DOD is required
to measure. It is the amount of time
between a contract solicitation and
contract award. Two years ago, we did a
whole episode on GAO's analysis of palt
procurement administrative lead time
tracking across the department of
defense, army, navy, air force,
everybody. They have to legally track
these metrics because Congress and the
department want that window to be as
small as possible. Meaning they want it
to be as soon as possible to go from
solicitation to award. So if you're
waiting until solicitation to get
started on a project that might take you
12 or 18 months, the those two things
are not aligned. You want the defense
contractor, you want the solicitation
and award window to be as long as
possible to prep for CMMC. Everybody
else wants it to be as short as possible
so they can move on and get these
systems uh sustained and developed and
fielded so on and so forth. This is why
in my opinion palt is the single most
useful metric for strategically planning
for CMMC. If you only have X dollars and
you got Y amount of time, it better fit
inside of Z palt or else you're going to
need to make some hard decisions. You're
either going to need to start on CMMC
before you see the requirement in a
solicitation, right? You need to spend
more money in order to go faster, which
is not always possible for most people.
Or you're going to have to skip that
contract entirely and go after another
one later on. And most people don't want
to do that and a bunch of people can't
do that. So, it's very very important
that you look at the palt window for the
contract opportunities that are coming
your way.
>> Let's talk about the you you put out
some hypothetical reasons why you should
get started early. Let's talk about the
real reasons that we're seeing, Jacob.
Right. The real reasons are uh start
before you see a solicitation. You said
that, right? What if you're not done and
you're not able to see the solicitation?
We see solicitations that require you to
prove that you have that certification
level before you get to see what's in
the contract to see if you even want to
bid on it, right? Do I want to bid on
this? Is this worth my time? I don't
know. I don't have the certification to
see it. So, we're seeing those stop gaps
being put in place by industry that
stops people from joining it. It makes
you want to get started a little bit
earlier. There there's really at this
point no excuse for you not to be
started.
>> Yeah, absolutely. And you know, uh quick
caveat, right? All everything we're
talking about here is prime awards from
the DoD to industry. So if you're a
subcontractor to a prime, that's a whole
other set of variables that you have to
deal with because they can just tell
you, hey, go get it now. You might have
no idea what the palt is. But I think
you'll find that the numbers are useful
even in that situation. But just be
aware that if you're on the other side
of a locked or a Northrep or an RTX, you
got another can of worms that you got to
deal with. Anyways, let's get to
something specific. Let's talk about Nav
Air. Nav Air is the Naval Air Systems
Command. It is the US Navy's primary
organization responsible for the full
life cycle support of naval aviation
from research, design, and acquisition
to testing, training, and sustainment of
aircraft, weapons, and systems for
sailors and marines. We're talking
missiles, jets, helicopters, drones.
Everything it takes to design, develop,
operate, and sustain those platforms.
all the software, all the parts,
everything that the Navy does with air
systems. Uh that is a lot of stuff. That
is a lot of money. That is a lot of
contractors. That means that's a lot of
contracts. How the heck are we going to
track all of that? That is what the long
range acquisition forecast is for. So
the LRAF, sometimes known as the long
range acquisition estimates, the LR AE,
these are projections of upcoming prime
contract opportunities over the next 12
to 24 months. They typically come out
every year. They are mandated uh to come
out. These are opportunities that are
going to be listed before they hit
SAM.gov.
It's mandated that they put this
information out specifically for small
business planning. That's great for
everybody listening to this. They list
the anticipated contract types, cost
plus, fixed price, sleource, all that
stuff. All that stuff they anticipate.
Uh they list all the anticipated
procurement methods. Uh everything from
full and open competition opportunities
to AA small business set aside
opportunities, everything in between.
They list out whether they're single
awards, whether they're purchase orders,
blanket purchase agreements, every kind
of procurement instrument that Nav Air
anticipates to use over the next one to
two years are listed in these. They're
typically spreadsheets. They also tell
you if it's new work or if it's followon
work, what the contract number is, who
the incumbent contractor is. Maybe
that's your prime that you're a
subcontractor to, which is going to be
very useful here. If you're not the
prime, you can find opportunities that
you might be supporting as a sub. So,
don't tune out just yet. Check out these
spreadsheets. Most importantly, the
fiscal year and quarter of the
anticipated solicitation and the fiscal
year and quarter of the anticipated
contract award. When we will see a
requirement, what CMMC level and when we
meet it by in order to take award of a
contract. CMMC is a condition of
contract awards. Sounds pretty useful,
right?
>> Yeah, sounds like something that if I
were an organization looking to get a
competitive advantage based off of some
certification requirement that I had, I
would look at this because it can allow
me to pinpoint opportunities in which I
might want to pursue because now I have
that certification in place, right?
>> Yeah, absolutely. So, in December, Nav
Air put out their most recent long range
forecast. It had $1676
opportunities listed. Everything above
$700,000 all the way up to multi-billion
dollar contracts. This is everything
from repairs, redesigns, prototypes,
everything in the Nav Air portfolio,
C130s to freaking drones, right?
Everything. In total on that
spreadsheet, which we'll link below so
you can do the numbers yourself, there's
1,070 opportunities that list both an
estimated solicitation date and a
contract award date. The two things we
need to calculate palt procurement
administrative lead time. Quick note on
how we counted. We're being very
generous here. Two things to know. We
assume the absolute bestcase scenario,
everybody, so be aware. and we counted
the quarters inclusively. So, first of
all, best case scenario, if the Navy
anticipates a solicitation in Q1 of
2026, we assume it's the first day of
the quarter, not the last day of the
quarter. If they anticipate awarding the
contract in Q2 of 2026, we assume it's
the last day of the quarter, not the
first. So, you get both full quarters.
Bestcase scenario. That's not always
true, but we're being nice, right?
Second, we counted the quarters
inclusively. So if we went from Q1 26
2026 to Q2 of 2026, that's six months,
two quarters, not the span between the
quarters as one quarter. Right? So Q2 of
2026 to Q2 of 2027 would be five
quarters because we're including the
first one, not four quarters. Right? So
this is very generous best case scenario
counting and the numbers are still
pretty small. Totally not confusing at
all. Easy to track here. And it so
obviously there are going to be the
outliers that like something's going to
be presented the last day of a quarter
or whatever. But in a general
[clears throat] case, this is a good way
to go.
>> Yeah. Yeah. This is bestcase scenario,
right? So be aware as we start to jump
into the numbers here. So the numbers,
all NAVA air opportunities, all contract
values, all contracts that are both
considered classified and unclassified,
which is a very helpful way that they
break stuff down. In total,
170 opportunities on average, drum roll
please, 3.34
from solicitation to award. That means
on average 10 months to go from
basically zero, which is where most
people are at, to seeing the
solicitation to then being fully
compliant with DAR's clause 252204712
and holding a successful CMMC status
resulting from a CMMC assessment in your
hands. 10 months. Jason, how does that
make you feel about uh the average uh
chances for companies out there that are
waiting for solicitation to start? Is 10
months realistic?
>> Uh aside from the outliers where people
are creating certification boundaries
just to have the certification
boundaries created, right? Uh but in
situations where multiple enterprise
organizations need to go through and do
like I don't know scouring and searching
for CUI within the environment, business
processes and locking down data flows
and things of that nature. uh as I've
come accustomed to seeing over the past
few months, I I don't know if 10 months
is realistic whatsoever. It makes me
feel like that if there's a lot of
organizations waiting and that's what
they have lying in front of them. I
don't think there's enough time, Jacob.
>> Yeah, 10 months is pretty tight. 10
months is pretty tight and we've talked
about this a million times. A lot of
times it's not because of the
technology. It's not because of the
solution that you might be hiring us
for. it's because of decisions and
budgets and people, you know, deciding
that this is actually a priority and
getting everybody in the team to agree
and all those sorts of things. Then you
start talking about
>> project kickoffs and backlogs and this
and that and all of a sudden three or
four months went by.
>> Exactly. Like I I think people
automatically assume well if I get
started today in no world in no span are
you starting right today. your own
internal uh procurement timeline to
figure out whatever the funding is and
and to pay whatever you need to pay to
get started, right? That is going to
take, like you said, a considerable
amount of time. You're looking at one of
the quarters there yourself.
>> Yep. Less than a year. Less than a year.
Best case, by the way, but we crunched
some more of the numbers. That's
everything in the entire spreadsheet.
All 1,000 plus opportunities up to
multi-billion dollar opportunities.
Probably not super realistic for most
people. Uh most people listening to this
podcast are probably not bidding on
billion-dollar contracts. So we uh
crunch the numbers based on contract
value. So all unclassified opportunities
just to make things simple. Of course a
classified contract could easily result
in purchase orders and things like that
that have CMMC requirements in it. But
just for the sake of simplicity, we use
the unclassified opportunities. So all
unclassified opportunities, all contract
values, right? So, if you get rid of all
the classified contracts, that cuts
everything in half. You're down to 550
opportunities. Average time 3.1
quarters. That's nine months from
solicitation to contract award for the
unclassified contracts. That means some
of the classified contracts bump that
up, but only by 0.2 quarters. So, a
couple weeks of extra time. Most
importantly, if we look at unclassified
NAVAIR opportunities, less than $2
million, right? less than $2 million.
There's 294 of these listed in their
long range forecasts. On average, the
period of time from solicitation to
award, 2.7 quarters, just about eight
months of time from the time they say
you need CMMC level two certification.
And if you don't have it, you're not
getting this contract. We're getting
smaller the smaller the contract gets
because smaller awards just don't take
as long as big awards. So the smaller
you are, the smaller the work that
you're going after, the faster you will
need to go, the more likely you will
have to start on your implementation
before you see the solicitation. Right.
That's that's really the catch here.
>> Yeah, Jacob, eight months, I can tell
you is not realistic for 85% of the
organizations that I've spoken to in the
past 90 days.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I would agree based off of
what I've seen and heard out there as
well. But maybe it'll change. If you're
going after bigger opportunities, you
want to grow your company, you've been
scaling, you've been doing all these
things. Let's talk about opportunities.
$2 million to $7.5 million. There's 86
of those that Nav Air anticipates coming
up. On average, 3.3 quarters, nine
months from solicitation to award. I
would imagine that as these awards get
bigger, they get slightly more
complicated. There's more data flows.
There's probably more things that you
got to anticipate. They're going to take
longer to get ready for. They're still
going to have CMMC requirements in it
because those are the baseline
requirements. But jumping up from less
than 2 million to 2 million to 7.5 only
gets you a couple extra weeks of
preparation time. Doesn't actually
really give you any more time. Uh even
though the contract to you would be
significantly bigger.
>> It's as the opportunities decrease. I my
thought process would be like smaller
opportunities, more cookie cutter
opportunities, and the average would go
down. It would have to be quicker. I can
understand why there's like obviously
more considerations in the larger
contracts.
I don't know.
So, we're still at an opport we're still
at a point in time where you're talking
about the opportunities and the timeline
for the opportunities where I've spoken
to organizations that are in position to
meet this deadline within this.
>> Yeah, we're still talking way less than
a year. Not not even close to a year.
Actually, as we go through these
categories of award sides, it's going to
be a while before we see anything that
on average is close to a year. So let's
talk about things from 7.5 million to
$50 million. These are getting to be
pretty big awards. There's 92 of these
listed in the Nav Air acquisition and on
average 3.34 nine months from
solicitation to award. The procurement
administrative lead time, you see a
solicitation, it says you need CMC level
two certification. If you don't have it,
you don't get the contract. You get nine
months to go. probably not enough time
for most of the companies that we've
talked to out there, whether they do
business with us or not, because we
talked to a lot of companies out there
that are just trying to feel out what's
going on. We're still at way less than a
year, but we're up to $50 million
>> Yeah. As the numbers go up, the
timeline's not going up. So, you're
again, we're beating the dead horse that
doesn't matter what size the contract
is, what size the organization is, or
who's bidding on it. It's just the
contract.
>> Listen, let's jump let's jump it up to
the next category of contracts. 50
million to a hundred million. We're
bidden on a $100 million worth of work.
Lot of money. You better believe that
this is going to be a huge priority for
leadership. This isn't some hobby that
people are going after. We want to win
this work. We might need to win this
work. This could set up the company
forever. This might define whether the
company makes it or not. $50 million is
a lot of dollars. There's 23
opportunities in the NAV Air acquisition
forecast. And they have an average palt
of, you guessed it, 3.4 quarters. Call
it 9 and a half months from solicitation
and award. We've only added a couple
extra weeks and we're at 50 to$100
million. We're not getting more time to
get CMMC for bigger and bigger awards
that are probably going to have more and
more gravity and dire circumstances for
not winning. And something that I I just
thought about like you said that $50 to
$100 million could be like an
organizational changing quantity, right?
Like you could make or break your entire
income.
>> If a $50 million contract ain't a big
deal to you, you're probably not
listening to this podcast, you know?
>> But let's think about something else,
Jacob. We just listed everything under a
hundred million and threshold, right?
especially like the the 2 to 7.5
millions where I know multiple
organizations that maybe have four or
five or six of those, right? So now
you're talking about meeting that
deadline at at six different
occurrences. Like obviously if you meet
the certification once, but when when
are they going to pop up? Like when are
you going to have to meet it? That's the
livelihood. That's the entire livelihood
of some organizations is five of those
contracts with less than nine months
time, you know, to to be ready.
>> Yeah, absolutely. All right. You know,
they give them in the spreadsheet. So
we'll talk about them. Let's talk about
awards. A h 100red million to $250
million. If that's you, there's 15 of
these opportunities that Nav Air
anticipates coming up here pretty soon.
And good news, on average, they think
it's going to be more than 9 months.
They give you 5.1 quarters. 15 months of
anticipated time from solicitation to
award. That's pretty good. 15 months is
a decent amount of time. Sounds pretty
solid. So, if you would like to have a
15-month window to go from learning
about CMMC requirement to holding the
certification in your hand, you better
be bidding on contracts that are worth a
hundred to 250 million bucks. Otherwise,
you better be able to get that done in
nine months or less.
>> Yeah. So, it took us to get to the
$und00 million threshold for me to get
that weird butterfly feeling in my
stomach that it gave me when you were
like, "Yeah, this is the average time.
This is the first timeline I feel
comfortable with." If an organization
came and said, "Hey, all of our
contracts are above 100 million." Okay,
well, yeah, you have some time. You you
don't have to freak out right now, but
let's still let's get started now.
>> Right? We're dwindling in the number of
opportunities here, but we're almost
done. We got two more categories.
Everything from 250 million to a billion
dollar in terms of contract
opportunities. There's 11 of those. Nav
Air is a big deal. That's a big portion
of the Navy budget. There's a lot of
stuff going on. $250 million to a
billion dollars on these contracts. On
average, we're right back to where we
started. 3.8 quarters, 11 and a half
months, less than a year to go from
solicitation to contract award.
Obviously, it could be the nature of the
work, could be their projection. We are
not at 18 months. We are not at 24
months. We are not at two plus years of
time to prep. We're talking you might
have maybe over a year if you're at a
100 million, 250 million, but all of
these on average are on average taken
less than a year.
>> Wait, we're going the other way again.
>> We're going the other way now.
>> I thought this number was supposed to
bump up like
>> like we talked about in that GAO episode
two years ago. Congress and the DoD
don't want to have billiondoll
opportunities take years to award. They
want it to get done. They want to do the
business. They want that palt window to
be as small as possible. That's bad news
for you if you want the palt window to
be as large as possible because the
world is changing around you. Let's talk
about everything over a billion dollars.
If you are going after contracts that
are worth more than a billion dollars,
please call us. We would love to help
you.
>> Yes, [laughter]
>> we will we will we will clear our
calendar to take your call. [laughter]
There are seven opportunities listed in
the NAV Air long range acquisition
forecast and they on average have a
pulse time of 5.1 quarters. 15 months
from solicitation to contract award. I
don't know, call me crazy, but if you're
working on a billion dollar project, 15
months doesn't sound like a lot of time
to get everything in order because
you're probably pretty big. It's
probably pretty complicated. You
probably got a lot going on. There's a
lot of people that get to make decisions
in an organization that size. So, uh, it
might sound great that there's a bunch
of money flowing around, but 15 months
is not a lot of time.
>> So, the way CMMC works right now, Jacob,
is is for me as a prime contractor to
accept a solicitation, obviously, I need
to be certified, but I also need to keep
track of all the UIDs of all the
organizations in my supply chain which
are going to contribute to my successful
delivery of this contract. Right, Jacob?
So, as the prime contractor now, I'm
looking at a pull time for Navy uh, for
Nav Air at 15 months, right? at most if
I want to go for the billion. Do you
think that I'm sitting idly by uh with
my supply chain and being like, "Hey
guys, you have 15 months or do you think
I'm asking them right now what you have
and if they don't have it or if I got
the butterflies again in my stomach?" I
don't know if I'm a prime contractor,
I'm putting out supply letters that say,
"Contact us if you're certified." Right.
Also, yeah, I mean there's that, you
know, exactly like, you know, Elbert's
putting out their supplier letters
because listen, if you're putting
advanced components on uh unmanned
systems that fire precision munitions,
uh you're probably going to have to do
CMC level two certification. They're
probably not giving you CMMC level one
or your customer who's the prime on that
contract is almost certainly going to
need CMMC level two. So, it's not that
big of a stretch at this point to be
like, "We're going to need this." So,
waiting until you see it in the
solicitation is really just burning a
lot of time when you don't have a lot of
time. So, sometimes people will hear,
"Oh, it's the phased roll out or we're
in phase one or this or that or the it
won't be fully implemented until the
phased roll out is done in 2028." Forget
all that. Besides the fact that all that
is very squishy and not hardline policy,
what type of work do you do
specifically? Which contracts do you
work on specifically? You can go to the
long range acquisition forecasts, look
up that work or those contracts
specifically and calculate how much time
you will have between solicitation and
award and know exactly what kind of
window you have in order to prep and get
CMMC. You don't have to get sold
anything. You don't have to get promised
anything. You can go do the math
yourself. Uh yeah, it's right there for
everybody to get. We've been trying to
bang the drum on Paul for everybody for
a long time because you don't have to
take our word for it. You know, you guys
know better than than anybody else what
kind of work you do, what contracts you
do, what kind of contracts you would
like to do, and uh it'll tell you uh
right there in the spreadsheet when
they're going to solicit it and when
they're going to award it. And by the
way, when you break down everything, uh,
you know, 30 to 35% of these awards are
Q2 of 2026. So, there's going to be a
big influx of this stuff coming up. I
don't know historically if that's always
Q2 is like the big time when stuff gets
awarded, but if you're thinking, oh,
phase two of CMMC's roll out starts in
November, that means that Q2 of 2027 is
going to be when a bunch of stuff is
coming up for award, which means there's
going to be a big influx over the next
year of solicitations with CMMC level
two certification requirements. You're
just not going to have 12, 18, 24 months
to get ready. You're going to have nine,
six, 3 months depending on when you see
your solicitation, when you get
everybody together and decide we're
going to dedicate the money and the
budget to it. So, don't be like
everybody else. Don't overestimate your
readiness. Don't underestimate how small
these windows are from solicitation to
award. Yeah, Jacob, I'm just going to
say one more thing that from what I've
been seeing is that like I obviously
there's a lot of noise about like the
DoD says it's going to require this or
the DoD hasn't required CMMC and
contracts because of blah blah blah,
right? The so you don't have that
requirement, all of that noise, right? I
I'm going to tell you that
everyone except for maybe one of the
clients that I've spoken to in the past
90 days, their requirement, they knew
that they had it and it didn't come
directly from the DoD. It came from the
people that give them money to pay their
bills.
>> Yep. Yep. Absolutely. Lots of variables
out there, but I hope the Paul uh idea
helps everybody sort of with some
clarity on what's going on. We'll link
to the Nav Air spreadsheet. Uh is that
helpful? Do you guys think this is the
right type of analysis to do? Did we
miss something in the spreadsheet? We'll
definitely be looking at NAVC, NAV War,
NAVSU, and the rest of them coming up in
the future as well. And uh yeah, like,
subscribe, and we'll see you next week.
