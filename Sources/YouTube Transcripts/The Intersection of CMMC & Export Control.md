Hello everybody and welcome back to
another episode of that CMMC show. Uh
today we have an interesting
intersection of topics. We have CMMC and
CUI joined with that of the export
control world and who better to talk to
it than the president of DTS Steven
Casaza. There's your word. I got your
last name right that go. um to actually
walk us through the intersection of CUI
and export control, when they play
together, when they could potentially
play a part, and then because this is
around the Halloween time, we're going
to share some horror stories of export
control, which everybody loves to talk
about. So, Stephen, Mike, over to you,
my friend. Who is DTS and what services
you guys actually provide in this space?
What do you guys do?
Thank you very much Daniel for the
introduction and thanks to Summit 7 for
having me on the podcast today. So Steve
Cassaza, president of Defense Trade
Solutions and what we do is, you know,
my team's pretty lucky. They get to wake
up every morning and like your team help
make the world a safer place. And what
they do is they're really a fractional
global trade compliance office for small
and midsize aerospace and defense
companies really helping navigate ITAR E
foreign military sales technology
security and foreign disclosure
logistics customs compliance and
international government affairs type
issues. So for those small mid-size
companies that don't have access to 100
export control nerds or 100 foreign
military sales experts, we're the shop
to go and make that happen for those
companies and really help make export
controls a competitive advantage for
them and not a hindrance to
international business.
>> Trade compliance as a service.
>> Exactly.
>> What a what a great thing because I know
a lot of MSPs and MSSPs out there, but
not a lot of people that want to play in
the export control regulation trade
compliance game. So, it's nice to know
SMB doesn't have to be left out of
having to hire multiple six-figure
salaries to just do one part of their
business. They can call you guys up and
be like, "Hey, I just need some help
figuring this thing out. How do I even
get a license for this thing?" Right?
What are the steps I have to do? Is this
even export control? I've been getting
that question so much recently. It's
like the things I have actually export
control or not? I was like, I don't
know. I'm not a trade compliance guy.
It's like I can help you by pointing you
at the USML, right? Right. It's like if
it looks like it's in there, well, you
you're probably got a problem. And then
I was like, call Stephen. He can help
you.
>> Spot on. Spot on. And one of the
interesting things, too, is that
everything we just described, generally
in the export control world, it requires
multiple different kinds of humans. So,
generally expertise falls into a
licensing, compliance, logistics,
releasability, FMS kind of category. And
so, you know, rather than having to have
five different kinds of humans, you
really get, you know, the for the price
of one, you get all those different
areas of expertise.
>> Ma'am, that's awesome. Which brings us
to really one of the first major points.
And again, you and I have kind of
wrestled with this topic off and on. I I
actually was able to write a piece
around export control violations that
we're actually seeing simply because
people are now doing CMMC. Because what
I've realized very quickly, you know,
even small businesses that have some
sort of trade compliance support,
they're typically not talking to it and
it is definitely not talking to them.
And so you have people stamping things
and getting things processed and
licenses and, you know, classifications.
You've got that whole team doing that
piece, but they're not like, "Hey, it uh
I think we're in the wrong Microsoft
cloud." Because they have no one like
they don't necessarily care per se.
They're doing their part of the job. And
so one of the first things I always like
to bring up is that CUI and export
controller, CUI and ITAR, those are two
different things, two different
requirements for protection, but ITAR
can also fit under CMMC if it's done
under a federal contract. And so can you
kind of walk me through when do I treat
these independent
>> and then when do I have to treat them as
like a single thing?
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. And so it's a
very interesting vin diagram we have of
cui versus export control information.
So talking about it from an export
control perspective. First really export
control information falls into two
flavors. You have ITAR control technical
data which is technical details
information software etc pertaining to
defense articles and then you have E
control technology which is similar you
know but on the commercial and dual use
side of things. And those are the
regulatory definitions when it comes to
export controlled information. There is
no consideration really for whether that
information was developed under a US
government contract, whether it was
developed by a company, whether it was
developed by an individual. It's really
whether or not you meet those
definitions in the regulatory
requirements under the ITAR or the EA
part. Full stop. So that's one side. And
then the other part of the de the ven
diagram is your controlled unclassified
information which for our purposes here
with the aerospace and defense industry
is really that information that is being
provided to
companies under US government contracts
or when bidding on US government
contracts in some kind of capacity. Now
the US government when categorizing
controlled unclassified information one
of the categories can be export
controlled information and so that's
when the US government goes and they
have their own technical data technology
and so it technical data and technology
that meets the definitions of both the
ITAR and the E but it's also being
provided through the course of
contractual discussions or contractual
requirements and because the US
government is providing it to a
contractor they market underneath the
umbrella of control of unclassified
information as well.
So if I'm if I'm hearing this right, so
I know that Department of State runs the
ITAR program. We'll say Department of
Commerce runs E, which obviously in the
world of DoD, those are separate
agencies completely. Now DoD is saying,
"Hey, with Dar 712 and CMMC, anything
that's CUI, apply the 110 controls of
NIST 8001 171, um, Fed ramp moderate
clouds or equivalent clouds, incident
response, flowdowns to your subs,
accountability of your subs, and things
like that. But if I'm making a weapon
for the DoD, not only is that CUI
because it's on a federal contract and
the type of data is considered
controlled unclassified information, but
now I've got the Department of State
looking at me in the sense of, oh,
that's an export requirement as well.
And you're saying that my export control
data can either be developed proprietary
through my organization or on behalf of
a federal contract. And no matter what,
I still have to also abide by that,
which correct me if I'm wrong, most of
those on under the commerce and state
side are data sovereignty, so keep the
data in the US unless you have an
appropriate license, and an access
requirement, which is US persons or
those with uh technical assistance
agreements um can be the ones that see
this or access this information. Is that
the extent of the extra requirements
kind of above and beyond what CUI is or
is there even more nuance to what you
can actually do with that data from an
export control piece?
>> At a high level that is that is the main
requirement. It's it's really where you
know where the data is stored and
resides right and so that's you know
from an export perspective it's in the
if it's in the US it's not an export
right um but if it moves outside of the
US then it would be an export but then
there's also a release component which
is you can have something that is you
know controlled from an export
perspective but you know you're it's
data that is only being accessed by US
persons and you can prove that and there
are the right encryption controls around
that in which case there are exemptions
to allow for export control either
technical data or technology outside the
US for exclusive US person's use because
people travel and and all that but if
there is a release of that information
or that technical data or that
technology ology, then those certain
exemptions don't apply anymore because
you've now just transferred that
information, technology or technical
data to a non US person. And so what
ends up being very challenging for um
for exporters when they are not looking
at export controls from a IT
perspective. Yeah. is they'll have
export control data all over the place
all over either their cloud
infrastructure or even their servers and
they don't really know where it is and
where it resides and it becomes very
hard to prove the negative of that your
information has not been exported
outside the United States or there has
not been a release of that technical
data or technology to IT personnel that
are managing the backup halfway around
the world, right? And so one of the
great things about CMMC
and the intersection I think of um of
CUI and export controlled information is
that CMNC is is really providing that
cyber security hygiene that allows for
not just the protection of CUI in a
sufficient way but also the protection
of export control information in a
sufficient way even if it wasn't
developed under a US government
contract. If you're if you're
maintaining good cyber security hygiene
to comply with CMMC, a byproduct of that
is you're going to as long as you know
where your export control information
is, you can apply those same principles
to your export control data.
>> So that's I think was interesting is
like access control is a really big
family in CMMC and this it's like listen
first family you got to control the
devices and people and service accounts
that are actually accessing right hard
stop like that's just level one kind of
stuff. So, when I wrote that blog not
too long ago, it was inspired by a
conversation I had with a very large
weapons manufacturer. They do a
combination of defense and commercial,
but it's a I'll call them a household
name when it comes to weapons.
And I remember being on the call with
them and their IT team, and we were
battling around cloud providers. Hey,
we're in commercial today. Um, and we
think we're good. It's like, okay, well,
let me pull up Microsoft's contractual
obligation to you. And Microsoft says,
no, no, no. you have ITAR e technical
data packages related to that you can't
put it in commercial because to your
point Microsoft will not prove that has
not been released to somebody else or
another country right if they have a
disaster recovery effort or something
like that and so in this conversation
the IT team's like well you know we
think we're okay I was like okay why
don't you call your trade compliance
team because they're big enough uh
they're I was like I would love to just
have you on the call and have me on the
call and have them on the
and about 30 seconds in to that
follow-up meeting we had, all of a
sudden their trade compliance when I'm
talking about unauthorized disclosures
or release of information,
uh, and I show them the Microsoft terms
and I show them that beautiful little
ITAR crosswalk and they look at me and
they look at their IT team and say, "No,
we're actually in violation and we need
to hang up the call right now and we
need to go remediate things." And so
it's just interesting when you hear this
stuff that conversation I don't think
would have ever happened unless CMMC was
in the mix primarily talking about data
sovereignty of cloud providers their
external support team because they had
an MSP a global MSP problematic
and just the simple fact of like hey
we're just in the wrong cloud like this
cloud provider is not actually allowing
us the contractual requirement that we
need to say that this data is protected
according to not only the DoD, but
something that carries even more
penalties, which is an export control
violation with like the Department of
State or Department of Commerce. And so,
what's interesting in that, and I love
I'm going to skip kind of down to a
question, is you know, horror stories
around that. So, we'll get into industry
updates here at the tail end of that,
but I want to jump straight. It's around
the Halloween season and we jokingly say
and it's it's kind of tongue and cheek.
You know, whoever makes the decision to
do something the improper way, whether
that's because they don't have the money
to do it or just want to lean into it
because it's easier and they're like,
somebody's making that corporate risk
decision about mishandling this
information. Um, we always like to joke
and say, who has to write the check or
who gets to wear orange, right? who
looks good in, you know, silver
bracelets, if you will. And so CUI,
there hasn't been a lot of uh how do you
say this? A lot of like lawsuits, per
se, yet, right? There's False Claims
Act, and that's starting to ramp up more
with the Civil Fraud Initiative or the
Cyber Fraud Initiative. Um, but Export
Control has a track record of decades
of, hey, we're going to put you in jail
or we're going to charge you a lot of
money for violation of this. And so much
of the defense industrial base because
they're dealing with this technical
information as space or military
application, they're simultaneously
working with export control and CUI and
they most of the time have no idea.
>> So if you were to tell tell the viewers
that are watching this, what are some
what are some penalties or what are some
horror stories of past organizations who
have done this incorrectly? um just to
kind of like liven it up and make it a
little bit more real that if you do this
the wrong way, there actually are
repercussions to it.
>> Yeah, absolutely. And and so I won't
call it specific companies, but at a at
a high level, I will say, you know, just
from the ITAR from from that
perspective, and each individual
violation of the ITAR carries up to it,
a civil penalty of a little over $1.2
million per individual violation. And so
what we tell our customers is just the
way the ITAR is structured, it's
actually really hard to only violate the
ITAR once.
>> Oh, interesting.
>> Usually if you mess up, it's you
violated the ITAR no less than a dozen
or two dozen times in different spots.
And so what ends up happening is
companies that get caught for violations
with the ITAR, uh, State Department,
Department of Justice, when they decide
to go after them, you know, and approve
the compliance program, they'll say,
"We'll have reason to believe you
violated the ITAR all of these different
hundreds of times. But if you consent to
guilt to under this consent agreement
and agree to these remedial compliance
measures, we'll only find you, you know,
$50 million. And half of that you can
reinvest into your compliance program."
So my hats off to Department of State
for really having a structure where
they're not just going after companies.
They're, you know, for, you know,
dollars for the sake of dollars. They're
actually having the companies reinvest
that money into building best-in-class
compliance programs. And so on to the
horror stories. I mean, so in terms of I
actually think this is companies that
struggle the most with this in the
defense industrial base are those
companies that actually deal with both u
dual use commercial and military because
what tends to happen is they tend to be
global companies. They tend to have
mixed workforces from a US national and
foreign national perspective. And it
become and you know when you're a
company it become you want to have as
much innovation happening as possible
which means as much access and
collaboration as possible right and so
we we know a number of companies you
know that have been under consent
agreement where they have a military
division and a commercial division and
the commercial division employees
Chinese nationals and you know and you
know foreign nationals in China Hong
Kong etc and without the proper for IT
access controls. Those nationalities,
you know, allegedly had access to a
number of, you know, documents, data,
information related to military
programs. And, you know, China is one of
the countries that we're actively
competing in competing with from a
defense industrial base. So, you know,
that data could very well give, you
know, the Chinese defense industrial
base an edge in reverse engineering, you
know, what we're doing here in the
United States. So, that's a that's
that's one horror story.
I would say another and this is kind of
going the the other way and this and
this recently happened. So it's actually
what happens when there's a little bit
of over control.
>> Oh, interesting. We we have a situation
right now with the customer that's in
this case where um there
are a number of documents that were
received by a government contractor that
were marked as CUI from the US
government and the reason you know
reasons for control the control
parameters were export controlled
information and specifically calling
that export control information ITAR
control information.
And when you look at the the the
documents that were received by that com
that company,
it's financial info, it's programmatic
info, the things that are technical in
looking at it. If you actually do the
jurisdiction classification analysis,
it's for parts and components of the
overall program that is not IR
controlled. It's, you know, be best case
E controlled, potentially even not E
controlled. the AR99 potentially. And so
there's a situation where the US
government just by the nature of you
know government employees potentially
rounding up to be safe and and all of
that over
>> CIA with not only CUI CIA with ITAR it
sounds
>> right. Right. And now we're we're in an
active situation where we're trying to
work through, you know, our customers a
sub in this case, work through the prime
to then work through with the government
to say, hey, we've done this analysis
against the ITAR and the E and there's
no technical data or E control
technology here. So because we want to
go and do other things and not be
subject to those controls, can you
remove these markings? And we're
actually having to educate the
government on how export control
information you can't you don't just
slap a label on that. There's actually
deci analysis that you have to go
through with the IT and E to come to
those conclusions. Yeah. And you know
it's it's becoming a very difficult
challenge for the company. A lot of
people are like, "Oh, it's just like FO
days." Like, you know, we we see
disclaimers on emails like signature
blocks. It's like, this email may
contain CUI. And it's like, hey, do you
want to go have lunch today? It's like,
well, number one, that doesn't contain
CUI. Nice try. But to your point, it's
making the burden on the subs and the
primes
unnecessarily burdensome. And it's like,
guys, like we get we want to protect the
data. We want to do the right thing, but
also don't say everything is CUI. Don't
say everything is ITAR. Just don't do
that because now honestly it's a little
problematic because now we end up in
these weird disputes where we're having
to come back as the contractor, not the
people who wrote the regulation, people
who are trying to follow it and educate
you about the same the thing that you
wrote. Right. And anyways, that's a
tales oldest time from the industry
parts that I've been a part of. Um it's
very frustrating and it the subs and
prime should just kind of be how do I
say this? they should be frustrated, you
know, because they're trying to do the
right thing. And so anyways, DoD,
Department of State, Department of
Commerce, please, you know, or
Department of War, I guess now, uh,
please try and not overmark things for
the sake of your supply chain. They
would greatly appreciate it. I'm going
to snip this, put it on LinkedIn. We're
going to tag a bunch of people saying,
"Please just don't do this, guys. Be
better." Um, okay. Horror stories to
side because those are really good. And
it's interesting. It shows both sides of
it. It's like we tried to do the right
thing, but then they're coming after us
for kind of benign stuff and then also
like, hey, we actually did the wrong
thing and there's penalties associated
with that. I keep hearing about this
August thing. This August thing is
making the rounds. I've got Australian
friends. They care about it, I think,
more than the US does. They're very
interested in bringing that work to
Australia. Um, tell me about just
general industry updates even outside of
August. that's happening in the in the
export control space that I should know
that could impact my organization.
>> Yeah, absolutely. And AUS will be a part
of this. But so at the high at the high
level um just even beyond export
controls and just looking at the defense
industrial landscape for a second
between you know when it comes to Doge
that happened earlier this year and now
the US government shutdown you know what
we've seen in the past six months
numerous numerous defense companies are
US defense companies are looking to
diversify their portfolio away from
domestic business and towards
international you know just trouble at
home be on one of those data points. And
then also the world becoming more and
more an unsafe place. Our allies are
training and equipping themselves, but
they're still relying on the US defense
industrial base in order to be able to
do that effectively and be
interoperable. Whether we're talking
about Europe, whether we're talking
about Taiwan, whether we're talking
about Israel. So between those two
things, just the marketplace is ripe for
US defense companies going after
international business. So we've seen a
lot more activity in that area and it's
sparked for companies to do that.
>> Yeah,
>> that's data point one.
>> Um data point two is it's becoming very
very challenging to be a global trade
compliance professional. uh the kinds of
questions that are coming out of this
environment from I would say market
pressure plus significant amount of
reform both on the export control side
as well as the form military sales and
direct commercial sales side between
border doing FMS and DCS reforms to
amendments to the ITAR from a USML what
are reasons for control perspective to
the 50% rule on the E A the foreign
direct product rule on the E A. I was at
a conference in the UK a few weeks ago
where I heard a term that I never
thought I'd hear. It's called E taint.
So we knew about ITAR taint in terms of
keeping the ITAR away from things sold
in Europe to prevent extr territorial
controls on, you know, on European
products. But now they're worried about
E taint because the A's reach is is
starting to become deeper and deeper
into Europe. And so all of these reforms
while a lot of them are good you know
and will result in deregulation
um a the other half are more and more
stringent control. So that's creating a
lot more regulatory complexity for
global trade practitioners to wade
through. So that's that's a second data
point. A third is there this
administration has actually increased
the amount of export control enforcement
that has been occurring. So if you talk
about headcount increases both in state
and commerce the focus is really more on
enforcement um and compliance personnel
um you're seeing the the fines that I
quoted have actually incre you know the
numbers that I quoted are higher than
were last year um and you're you're
hearing a lot more enforcement actions
you know coming out of coming out of
that too so the the environment is more
complex there's more demand for a US
military technology and there's a higher
risk So, global trade compliance
professionals, it's not like that we've
gotten smarter as the time has gone on
or there's not like that there's more of
us that have just appeared. We're
feeling the strain of that. So, my heart
goes out to all fellow global trade
compliance professionals that are just
trying to get by the these days. But
with all that said, I would say that
it's important to have access for
defense companies to have access to that
kind of expertise because it's going to
be the only way you're able to to
navigate this landscape. And so that
brings me to AUS. So AUS is is something
that I'm a huge proponent of. I think it
is a great initiative both at the high
level in terms of going and and really
taking the three defense industrial
bases and making them tighter and
collaborate more not just with nuclear
power submarines but also amongst our
industries. Uh and the AUS exemption and
the expedited licensing timelines around
that are great tools for global trade
practitioners to have in their toolbox.
and we've a number of our customers
we've been navigating that the exemption
and using it quite effectively for them.
Having said that, we still and this is
kind of the chatter around AUS is that
it doesn't go far enough and that there
are a number of defense companies that
are not using the AUS exemption or the
AUS tools in their toolbox largely
because of the complexity around it. So
there's a trade-off with everything,
right? And so you basically add
complexity for increased speed and
agility. And so what tends to be
happening and and this was talked about
in the office forum last week is that um
a lot of the business development
professionals at defense companies,
they're the ones that are benefiting
from the speed and agility of AUS,
right? They get to go talk to their
industry colleagues faster. They don't
have to wait for licenses. It's great
for them.
>> Oh yeah. They love it. They love it. The
people that take the complexity side of
the equation are all the global trade
people that now, you know, have to make
a number of decisions every day and are
inherently risk averse humans
makes them good at their job. Yeah.
>> And so if there's something more complex
and inherently has a little bit more
risk to it and I only have so many hours
in the day, we're hearing a lot of
global trade professionals default to
just doing licenses and doing business
as usual, which is a shame.
>> It's the problem though, right? I mean,
when you get stressed, you just follow
the things you know. You don't want to
necessarily start something new in
order, you know, just for the sake of
the newness of it. Right.
>> Right. Right. And so, you know, my
advice, you know, to defense companies
that fit that profile is, you know,
allow the space for the global trade
team to work the problem and a good
opportunity to work through the Augustus
exemption is not in a high pressure
situation where orders need to go out
the door within the next two days. It's
being part of the international business
strategy that you've laid out for next
year and analyzing which things might be
able to fit under the AUS framework.
>> All right. It's interesting because I
mean the AUS I've heard so many good bad
parts of it. It's like this is a great
unifying thing between the UK and
Australia and the US, but then I've
heard like there's been back and forth
with you know the executive branch and
the president around okay are we doing
this? How are we going to do this? And
so anyways, it's interesting to hear the
insight of like, hey, a it actually
exists. It's just not a lot of people
are leveraging it because of the other
pressures they're around. Like, let's
just do regular licenses. Like, we know
how to do that. We can do that in our
sleep. Um, it's interesting to have that
kind of tension of new and faster
potentially uh but also slower simply
because you don't have enough capacity
or bandwidth or trade compliance people
to actually go forth and and do the work
needed to lay the groundwork. So yeah,
that's an interesting little tension
there.
>> Yep. And one thing to keep in the front,
you know, in, you know, when it comes to
August to keep in the front of
everyone's mind is that, you know, it's
not deregulating exports to the UK and
Australia. It's actually increasing the
walls around the UK, Australia, and the
US to allow freer trade between the
three countries. But the complexity
comes into play when you know you're
involving activities that need to cross
over that wall again or in into that
wall and all you've done is you've
extended the bounds of the ITAR really
instead of being around the United
States it's now around the UK and
Australia in a way and so that that
inherently it it doesn't increase
complexity it shifts it to to different
parts of the equation
>> well with that being said on the AUS
piece because I know it sounds like,
hey, people should be adding that to
their belt. On the closing remark side,
any other words of wisdom, Stephen, as
we kind of went through this today and
all of your experience and all the DTS
experience that you guys have, anything
related to export control that people
should be aware of intersections of CUI,
CMMC, landmines,
uh, you know, you have thousands of
people you are now communicating to.
give them some sage advice on navigating
this very complex landscape.
>> Yeah, absolutely. And so I think the the
best advice I can give is that we are a
global economy and the defense industry
is glob going global and we're you know
the world is just going to continue to
not you know to be a more dangerous
place and that's going to require allies
and partners to um be buying more US
origin technology and engaging more
complicated transactions. So having a
strong global trade compliance resource
is a competitive advantage for your
business and is not something to skimp
on. I would say a good comparison to
that would be having access to solid
cyber security hygiene, you know,
experts like at Summit 7. um to be able
to make sure that the the cyber security
infrastructure for your business is is
structured in a way to where you can go
and compete and get access to the US
government contracts because at the end
of the day whether you're talking about
global trade where you're talking about
cyber security and CMMC it's all
designed to protect the US warf fighter
and protect our technology at the end of
the day and so when you have the
resources and the expertise to be able
to do that then you can focus on winning
business then you can focus on
supporting ing our allies, then you can
focus on executing your contracts.
Without that foundation, you're going to
be left behind.
>> There it is. You heard it first, guys.
You've probably already heard that
before because it's a very common
message coming out of the space right
now. But at the same time, it doesn't
change the truth of it, right? It's
either you're going to have a strategic
advantage as a business or you're going
to lose ground in an area you might not
want to lose ground in. Right? And
that's just the reality of a regulated
space that we're entering into even more
so right than historically. So Stephen,
thank you for joining. Uh we love
partnering and working with DTS for any
kind of export control understanding and
needs and to your point like an
outsource partner that they can actually
levy as a small business which there's
not a lot of small business solutions
out there or SMB um in the trade
compliance space. You're actually the
only one that I know. So, um, great
company, great team. Stephen, we'll have
to have you on again. Thanks for
joining. And to everyone watching, uh,
we hope you enjoyed and we'll see you
next time.
>> Have a good one, guys.
>> Thank you, Daniel. Thanks, Summit 7.
