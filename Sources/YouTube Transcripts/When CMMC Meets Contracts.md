Hello everybody and welcome back to that
CMMC show. Today we have another
followup to people's favorite topics and
that is contracts and legal as it
relates to CMMC. Now I have somebody
who's been in the CMMC space even before
it was CMMC. It was the DEFAR space, the
DAR 7712 space. Don Stern is with me
today and Don, I'm so excited to get
into some very pointed questions that I
get asked all the time. I slept at a
holiday in Express, but I am not sadly a
lawyer. So, I'm going to pass things
over to you to see if we can get some
clarity around some of the contractual
obligations of CMMC both as the prime
receiving it and then what kind of
flowown stuff we have to work with today
work with as well. So, Don, first tell
us a little about yourself.
Thanks so much for having me. I I think
it is super important to um have the
dialogue between the technical side and
the legal side. So really appreciate you
all having me today. Um so um I co-chair
the government contracts practice at DA
Piper. DA Piper is a large global law
firm. We have 90 offices in over 40
countries around the world. Um and our
government contracts team um is also
global. Um our US government contracts
team advises companies that does that do
business with federal, state and local
governments. Um and so that is across
all aspects of that relationship whether
it's negotiating contracts, negotiating
teaming agreements, thinking about what
your compliance obligations are all the
way through government facing litigation
and supply chain litigation. So um
really thinks about look at looks we
look at things from all aspects and and
really help clients um throughout the
industry be thinking about what they
need to do um in order to be successful
in their government contracts um you
know and government facing work. Um me
personally, I've [snorts] been at the
firm um about 15 years now. Um and prior
to that, um was a trial attorney at the
Department of Justice where I handled uh
government contracts cases on behalf of
the government. So I tell folks I've
been on the dark side. You can pick
which one that is, but I've advised
companies and advised the government um
on all legal issues involving government
contracts. My practice now is um a lot
of litigation against the government and
also um with respect to investigations,
supply chain issues um and then have a a
just a real personal interest and niche
in advising clients on um CMMC and cyber
security. So hence our connection and
and really look forward to the
discussion today
>> and that that's you say the dark side
jokingly tell people all the time it's
like I was in it for 17 years. I did the
thing and then I switched to sales. But
they already know what the dark side is
there, right? It's like, oh, well, the
sales is obviously the dark side, right?
But what's interesting is that you've
seen it from every aspect, right? You're
on both both sides of the fence when it
comes to contracts and now because
you've been in the CMMC and DAR space
for so long, like you've seen probably
just about everything. Which leads me to
some very pointed questions. Don, I'm so
happy you're here. Uh, preface, I am not
a lawyer. She's not representing you. So
these are just a conversation and
questions that we're going to answer
today to the best of our ability. So
first up out of the gate, Don, this is a
fun one and this was one that somebody
posed me a few weeks ago and I think you
and I briefly talked about this before.
So if I'm an organization and I meet all
110 controls and I have a perfect 110 in
SPSS based on the DoD assessment
methodology, but I don't meet the Fed
ramp requirements as required by CMMC
and I go to SPRS to enter my score for
my CMMC level two self assessment.
What score do I put in? Can I put a
perfect 110 because I'm technically
meeting the control framework but I'm
not meeting the cloud and there's no
checkbox in spurs saying I have cui only
in fed rampant moderate or moderate
equivalent clouds. I've had people
wrestle with this because they're like
we don't want to lie but we're not lying
we're we're submitting all the options
that we have in the system. So first
question I know it's it's it's a hard
one in my opinion but you probably can
just cut through this immediately. So,
I'm going to turn the mic over to you.
>> Yeah, I I agree with you. I mean, I
think it is a hard question. Um,
interestingly,
we had never heard this and then maybe
like you in the last I'd say six months
or so, we have gotten this question in a
a few different um iterations of it from
different companies at different sizes.
Some of it I I think I can attribute to
maybe some of the Fed Ramp cloud
providers kind of changing um uh their
what they are providing or how they deem
their um you know the cloud. Um and I
think folks are just now realizing as
they're getting closer to their CMMC
assessments that this is kind of a
separate requirement. So, I don't really
know what to attribute that uptick to,
but I do find it interesting that you're
hearing it, and we've heard it a couple
of times as well. Um, the best I can say
is I think there's not a
one-sizefits-all
answer, and I hate to kind of give that
lawyer answer, but I think that's true.
Um, what is important is that you are
transparent with whatever representation
it is. So where I think the problem
comes in is if you tell the government
we have 110 and you're submitting
proposals that represent that you are
fully compliant with 7012. Um
>> yeah,
>> that's where that misrepresentation can
come in. So, I've had some clients say,
while not necessarily covered by one of
the 110 controls, we are going to give
ourselves 109 um simply to give the
government a heads up that there is
something and if the government has
questions, they can ask. Um I'd had
other companies take the 110, but put
some type of representation in proposals
when they think that makes sense. just
um can language that an attorney can
help draft to put something in again to
put the government on notice that this
is something you're aware of. You're
[snorts] not misrepresenting it. Um
you're working to fix it, whatever steps
you're taking. Um I've had others do
poems, so it's internally documented
that they're not meeting it and how what
they plan to do to fix it. So again, I
don't think there's a one-sizefits-all
answer as to how you deal with it. But I
think burying your head in the sand and
pretending that everything is okay, even
if you know that you're not meeting the
the Fed ramp requirements um is where
the the problems can happen.
>> Yeah. I I know Microsoft back in I think
it was October of 2024
ripped their Fed ramp authorization off
their M365 commercial cloud. And I can't
tell you the amount of people that were
like, "Wait, we were compliant." It's
like, well, for Fed RAM, sure, but
there's also an incident response
requirement in DAR 712 and but that
doesn't actually carry over to CMMC
certifications, which is fascinating.
That's the one part of 712 that didn't
make the jump over. And I asked the
cyber AB and they're like, yeah, that
was intentional. It's like, oh, okay,
that that's interesting, right? So, um,
but then people are like, oh, I'm I've
been in commercial. I talked to a
company not too long ago that was like,
we're ready. we just want a gap
assessment to figure out and just make
sure that we're good to go. Like we have
all the 110 controls. It's like, oh,
what cloud did you do it in? They're
like M365 commercial. And I was like,
I'm so sorry. Like I've got to be the
bearer of bad news because they ripped
that away about a year and a half ago.
And they're like, oh no. I one of the
the companies I talked to was about a
60,000 person defense contractor
>> and it was just insane, right? I mean,
tens of thousands of people and they
were like, "We've got to do this and fix
this like immediately, right?" And so,
it's so interesting when people bring
this up because it's not like Microsoft
or any other cloud vendor just has sends
you a text and say, "Oh, by the way, no
more Fed Ramp, right?" And so, people
get caught off guard a little bit, which
leads to, "Oh, I don't want to
misrepresent myself." Now there's the
other side of this which is also a fun
conversation which is my next question
that we get all the time which is the
penalty for posting an incorrect SPRS
score even if you didn't know right and
the didn't know part is is the
interesting part so when we're talking
to organizations
like either a couple things will happen
one the IT guy that submitted the SPRS
score is no longer there and they're
wrestling to figure out how to update it
right um and so that's The other kind of
big piece of it, um the outside of that,
it's oh, I just put a score because I
just went down to 110 and checked yes,
no, yes, no, yes, no, and that's how I
got my score. Because when you look at
scoring, it it doesn't actually, how do
I say this? It doesn't do a good job of
showing the assessment objectives. So
unless you know something is happening,
it's you don't really know if you're
scoring yourself correctly, right? And
so that's where the kind of the
confusion comes with a lot of people.
They're like, "Oh, I went down the 110."
It's like, "Yeah, but there's this thing
called 171A and you know, you actually,
you know, you didn't you got four out of
the five assessment objectives, but you
fail the whole thing if you don't get
all of them right." And so I think that
was kind of the interesting part is like
people just ignorance and didn't do the
research on how to score. And then you
have people that submitted an incorrect
score maybe intentionally. We've seen
that with, you know, other cases
previously where they were basically
strong armed into posting a score that
was perfect even though they knew it
wasn't. So now that I'm done talking and
explaining the question in more detail,
Don, what happens if my organization
submits an SPRS score that's incorrect,
either by me not knowing how to score
myself appropriately or someone just
intentionally did it wrong.
Yeah, I think you know those are two
really different um
different standards, right? So because
at the end of the day and what we're
seeing is the government has made no
secret of the fact that they are using
um the false claims act to um
review cyber security compliance and as
a potential enforcement mechanism for
failure to comply with the cyber
security requirements. That's a shift,
right? Because when this all started, if
we all remember when Katie Arrington
first rolled out the idea of CMMC and we
sat in conference rooms and we were all
talking about what it was going to look
like, it was a very kumbaya feeling. It
was a this is the government and us
working together to protect the
government's information and the stuff
that really needs to be out of the hands
of our adversaries. And and I think
that's right. And I think that feeling
um that that goal is still there. I
think everybody is still pulling in the
same direction and recognizes that's why
we need to do this. I mean, I I don't
think anybody's going to dispute we
don't want this information
um you know, in the hands of the wrong
people. Um but that kumbaya feeling
isn't there anymore because now the
government is using um the false claims
act as an enforcement mechanism and that
comes with significant
um monetary penalties. It can get into
the criminal side, right? So, it's
something now I think companies are more
focused on and thinking about, well,
where is that line? Um, the false claims
act standard is a knowing standard. Um,
so you do have to knowingly
misrepresent. However, that knowingly
category includes reckless disregard and
deliberate ignorance. So, I buried my
hand in my head in the sand. I didn't
think about um what the standard really
was. I spent five minutes and went down
the 110 and went check check check. I
meet them all and didn't actually take
my time as either the legal side, the
business side or the IT side to really
think about what this is and what the
scope is and what I'm doing. Generally,
that's where, you know, you could maybe
there's plausible deniability, right?
Maybe you could say, "Well, but I did it
and I didn't know that it was wrong."
Um, but you know, at that point that
doesn't really work if you're not doing
sufficient diligence in order to be able
to say, "Here's why I didn't know it was
wrong or here's why I had a good faith
reason for making the representation I
did." That's where the risk can come. So
if you are diligent, if you document the
basis for your decision, if you go
through and spend time, right, and you
you do it from a a standard of somebody
who is reasonable in that with your
knowledge and with your IT expertise and
and with the support that you have,
that's generally an okay defense to
well, I said we complied with this, but
when I brought in Summit or somebody
else to do a gap assessment. Um, we
realized that we had just missed the
mark a little bit and because of X, Y,
and Z. Um, that story makes a whole lot
more sense than I spent five minutes and
did check check the box and um and I,
you know, then I quote unquote didn't
know. Obviously, if we're deliberately
misrepresenting a score, um that
certainly comes with false claims act
risk, um breach of contract risk, I
mean, you name it. Um but the sort of
closer to the line is where I tried to
do my job and I just, you know, mefted
on a control or whatever. That's um
usually
um with the help of counsel, you know,
you can then figure out what happened.
Um the one thing I'll say in the
narrative that you gave that I think is
really important to highlight is the
documentation part because yeah it as we
all know is not uncommon for your IT
person to do the assessment and then
[snorts] the you know you're looking at
it two years later and saying oh
goodness Jim left and we don't know why
Jim marked us as compliant or not
compliant and we have no idea. So what's
critical in all of that is really making
sure that whoever is doing it is fully
documenting why and what the rationale
is so that whether it's one year, two
years, you know, somebody leaves,
somebody gets sick, whatever the case
is, um they can be able to figure out
what happened.
>> Now I have a followup to that actually
because you just sparked something in my
in my brain. DR712 and 7019 they don't
really call out a senior official or who
should submit the SPRS score
>> but CMMC has this thing this senior
official language in it where it's like
hey we actually want somebody that has
responsibility in the organization at a
higher level to actually post and
validate that yes this is a score from
your experience is that a specific type
of role that you typically see is this a
seuite is this a VP how what's a good
maybe line to walk there from how you
would deem what a senior official is.
>> Um I it depends on the company structure
and I think companies are handling it
differently. Smaller companies um we've
seen are going up to the you know
president level because that wh that's
who makes the most sense. Um, other
companies are, you know, your CISO type,
um, or perhaps somebody directly below
the CISO depending on the size of the
company who would have oversight and
sort of personal knowledge of the
assessment that was done. So, I really
think it depends, but it does need to be
generally
not the person who was responsible for
the assessment. So, it really does help
to have that additional, you know, the
day-to-day management of it, right? It
really helps to have it sort of one
person removed who can say this isn't my
baby and so I was able to look at it
objectively and and meet with them and
understand what was done and why it was
done and so I feel really comfortable
making that representation. um that
additional letter layer of objectivity
is just helpful if you know any of the
things we talked about go south and so
um it it again gives you a little bit
more of a story but that's not a you
know one-sizefits-all you must do that
it's just good practice if it's possible
>> okay now now that we've kind of isolated
the company level of SPRS scores this is
a question that people didn't really
honestly pay attention to in the D4712
days at least didn't pay attention well
and that is our good friend Mr.
Flowdown. So one of the things that CMMC
has really I'll say agitated a lot of
primes right now and a lot of them are
taking good steps. So like we just had
Elbert on one of our other podcasts with
Jacob and Jason and basically the
interview was hey if you guys aren't
certified like we're not going to use
you right at some point in time. Um, I
just got off the phone call with a small
business, a 50 person small
subcontractor that said Widos told them,
"If you're not certified by October,
we're taking you off our list." Right?
And so, we're starting to see this
narrative start coming out where it's
like, oh, like not only do I have to be
compliant that I've got to look
downstream potentially multiple
different tiers of suppliers and figure
out how do I manage and enforce CMMC
there, or do I even have to do that? So
the two questions I get all the time are
Daniel what exactly is my requirement
for CMMC and flowing down how far am I
responsible for and the other question
is is there a world in which I don't
have to flow this down to them right so
first question being what's my level of
responsibility and for how deep in the
supply chain second one being is there
any way to get around it basically is is
a summarized version of that so what's
your take on the CMMC contractual
flowown language as it applies to both
of those things.
>> Yeah, this is certainly an area I think
you're hearing it and we hear the same
thing on the legal side. It is tough. Um
and CMMC
while in in in a lot of instances has
taken a little bit of the um the risk
from contractors because now you've got
the C3PAO who's doing your assessment
and there's a little bit of that you
know the issue we were talking about
well what if I put in a 110 and I didn't
know that that risk goes down now
because somebody else is going to tell
you whether you have a 110 right
provided you give them the right
information to put into the the
assessment. Um but the supply chain risk
is there and it's and it's big and it's
significant and the reason is because of
the dynamic down the supply chain
because the CMMC puts in the primes
ambit of responsibility
the need for the prime to say you know
it's like the Oprah like you get a car
and you get a car you're going to get
cui you're going to get cui and you're
going to get cui Right? And so all of
you need to be level level two. And then
you have that tension between the prime
and the sub because the sub over here
says, "Wait a minute. All I make is
widgets. It doesn't matter what you're
putting it on. I don't need cui. I'm
going to give you my widget and you're
going to put it in your little whatever
you're building and and I don't need
cui. So why am I level two?" And that
tension starts and the government wants
to look at you and say not my problem.
Right? That is that is your prime
problem.
>> Yep. That is further complicated by the
fact that as we have all experienced the
government doesn't really want to tell
you what cui you are going to get. So,
it's a little bit of a whack-a-ole.
[snorts] And at the very beginning of a
contract, when often times companies
don't know where the contract
performance is going to lead or what
kind of information they're going to get
and they're in a position then to decide
who gets the cui, um, it becomes very
complicated. Um, and so I think you're
right. What we are seeing more and more
are companies taking the position that
they just want to get everybody in their
supply chain to a level two. And if
you're not willing to spend the money
and effort and time that is needed, then
perhaps they're going to look elsewhere.
>> Yeah. Um, in other instances, there are
primes that realize that they have a mom
and pop widget maker and nobody else in
the country makes this widget and so
they have to figure out a workaround
with that company. Whether that is
finding a way to keep that company at a
level one or finding a way to
share CUI with that company only on the
primes
level two system. Um uh you know you've
you've seen people
probably not the best practice but
moving toward paper documents. I mean
there I've heard all kinds of stories of
people finding trying to find a way when
that sub is indispensable. Um and so you
know but but as a business if you are a
smaller business and you are down the
supply chain the best thing you can do
is start moving toward your level two. I
think if you are doing that and you're
making reasonable efforts and you are
moving the needle, a lot of the primes
still have patience for that. They
understand that the line to get a
certification is long and the wait is
long and so they're they're able to work
with you to find workarounds until you
can get the certification. But if your
answer is I'm not doing it, that's not
for me. I don't want the Oprah car. Then
I think that those primes are starting
like you said more and more to say then
then we're going to find somebody else.
>> And that's what's interesting is like
these you know people are always like
Daniel but I'm a small business. I'm a
set aside. I've got all of these I'm
veteranowned. I'm disabled. I'm
minority. I'm womanown. Like you name
the the set aside list, right? and
they're like surely CMMC is not going to
impact that because the DO is obligated
to fund a certain amount or that's their
goal is to fund a certain amount of S
SBA and it's like no CMC trumps set
aides right and it's like even as a
blowdown requirement
>> if the data goes the clause goes right
and it's like it's one of those things
where it's like
>> it's agnostic of size right and that's
hard because the burden of
implementation and paying for a
certification I mean some organizations
could look even on the small side of
hundreds of thousands of dollars over a
multi-year implementation and
certification process. And so, um, it's
always interesting to see that tension,
right, of like, oh, can I get a get away
with, you know, getting it on my system
or giving them a paper copy or something
like that because everyone's trying to
crack that code because I personally
think I mean, we're looking at a pretty
large consolidation of the supply chain
in the defense space if if it holds true
the way that it's written. I I could I
could imagine somewhere north of 40%
deciding to exit may maybe a little bit
lower just because of the cost to do it.
They're like we'd rather go do our
commercial work until of course you know
FARCUI comes out and then they can't do
any federal work at all and we'll talk
about that on another podcast episode
because that's an emerging thing all on
its own. But
>> it's coming.
>> So we've hit a few definitely hot
topics. I'm going to throw a more
generic one out out at you and we talked
a little bit about False Claims Act. Are
there any other contract contract risk
people should be aware of as it relates
to DFAR 7012 and 719 20 and CMMC or is
FCA kind of the really big one in the
room?
>> Um, look, I mean, I think the threshold
one is losing your contracts. So, you
know, either because your your primes
don't want you if you're not level two
or you're not eligible for contracts if
they're issued, you know, at a certain
level. So that's the the biggest risk
and that's the one you know we all want
to avoid. So hopefully if we're
listening to this that's not where we
are. Um other than that certainly false
claims act like we've talked about um
supply chain like we've talked about I
think um you know and then
more and more granular when you're
actually talking about the assessment be
really thinking about your scoping
issues. So, like I said before, right,
it's it's that that assessment is only
as good as the information that you
provide. And so, if you are not scoping
your system correctly for your CMMC
assessment, if you're not thinking about
what CUI you get or how it flows through
your system, um all of those are risks.
Um, yep,
>> we see a lot on the M&A context. So, how
do I identify risk if I am looking to
acquire a new company or what do I need
to do if I am going to be looking to
sell my company in the near future? So,
all of those are things to be thinking
about um you know, as you're you're
thinking through your cyber compliance.
>> I've got one followup to that and it's
it's related to the M&A stuff. So, one
of the most loosely defined terms in
CMMC is significant change. the DoD
threw out this significant change
language where it's like significant
architectural or boundary changes,
expansions of networks, and mergers and
acquisitions. And that's the that's the
entirety of it. And they're like, "Hey,
one of these things happens as a
significant change, you got to go get
reertified, right?" what what have you
seen on the interpretation of like that
on the significant change or might be
too early on in the process to really
have seen that really come to light a
lot because of I think we're over 800
certifications I think now but um but
what's your take on that from an M&A
approach?
>> Yeah, it's a tough one. I I think you
know if you
in the near term where we've seen
clients going is thinking about when
your closing date is going to be um
visav your assessment right so if you
know and and this is you know all the
more reason yet another reason for why I
get on my soap box and say CMMC is not
an IT problem CMMC is a company problem
and we or or or company initiative,
right? So, we really need to be thinking
about it with business folks in the
room, legal in the room, management in
the room, IT, everybody's got to be on
the same page. So, because your IT folks
may not know that your leadership is
contemplating some, you know,
acquisition of another company and your
IT folks are now scheduling your CMNC
assessment a month before the closing of
that new acquisition. Well, maybe now we
want to push that assessment out three
months to allow the integration so then
we don't have the significant change
question pop up within two months after
we get um you know our level two. Um so
I think that all needs to be thought of
together. It I do think you're right
it's yet to be seen. it seems a bit
unmanageable
to
um for the AB to take the position that
anytime there's an acquisition, you need
a new CMMC certification or CMMC
assessment. Um it it seems particularly
with the waiting list they've got now
that's going to not be manageable in the
long term, but I just don't think we
know yet. Yeah, it's going to be
interesting to see what what shakes out
because you have to have a C3PAO tie the
cage code in EMAS in the background. So
it's like if you have a new cage code,
do you just wait? Like what happens to
performance of those contracts? What
happens to imminent contract awards in
between that? There's so many question
marks there, right, that people are
like, what do we do? And it's like
honestly, we don't quite have the
playbook yet, right? We don't really
know. And I hope DoD has been issuing a
lot of FAQ updates. I really hope that
they clarify significant change a little
bit more to maybe give a little bit more
flexibility there. I have a feeling
they'll probably over rotate and be more
prescriptive in maybe a more negative
light causing more harm than good, but
you know, we'll kind of wait and see
there. But all right, I got my last one
and I ask everybody this
>> wait.
>> Yeah, I think it we're gonna have to
really and that's what our second
episode will be about, Don. So, um,
closing remarks. I ask everybody
question.
>> This is going to be the fun thing. This
is the what's your favorite food all the
way up to how do I stay out of jail,
right? So, anything that you have in
regards to something you like to share
with the audience and the thousands of
viewers that we get. Um, anything that
just really strikes you as something you
you want to share with the audience
here?
>> Yeah. Stay out of jail. No, I [laughter]
or have have wine and dark chocolate to
until we figure this all out. Um, I I
think those are all fair and and I'd say
the last thing, right, and and we
touched on this is document, document,
document. Really make sure that you are
writing down um and accounting for the
decisions you make, the representations
you make, the assessment scope that you
do. Um, that documentation becomes
critical if there ever are questions
from the government. It really is what
we look to are those contemporaneous
documentations, not some post hoc thing
that you can then develop once you talk
to a lawyer and you're under
investigation. So, make sure to document
now and make sure to read your contract
now because there are still agency
specific requirements, there are still
command specific requirements, there are
varying reporting requirements. So, make
sure you're you're looking at those, you
know what they are. Um, and and that'll
hopefully keep everybody on the right
track.
>> I love it. Well, Don, thank you so much
for your time. This was an incredible
episode. You answered a lot of the
burning questions that I get asked all
the time. And I just say go talk to Don.
Right. So, um, Don, we'll hide your
contact and LinkedIn in the in the
YouTube video here so people can reach
out to you um, if they have any actual
contract questions and you obviously can
can have conversations and move forward
from there. But, thank you so much for
joining. Uh, this was such a pleasure.
I'm so happy to bring kind of the IT
cyber world back in with legal, right?
And so I wish they would talk to each
other more. I've been in so many calls
where I feel like just a mediator just
trying to build a bridge between those
two teams because they don't understand
what what's a corporate risk there. Um,
but you've just been such a breath of
fresh air. Thank you for joining and uh
we'll look forward to the next episode.
>> Thanks, Daniel. Appreciate you and the
whole team. Look forward to
>> Absolutely.
>> All right, everybody. Thanks for
watching and uh make sure to tune in the
next one.
