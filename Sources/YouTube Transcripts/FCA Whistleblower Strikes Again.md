All right, folks. It is December of
2025, almost the end of the year, and
wouldn't you know it, another False
Claims Act whistleblower has been paid
out by the Defense contractor that they
turned into the Department of Justice.
Swiss Automation Incorporated has agreed
to pay $421,234
to resolve alleged False Claims Act
violations relating to its failure to
provide adequate cyber security for
certain drawings of parts that the
company machined and supplied to
Department of Defense contractors. They
got turned in by their own employee
who's going to get $65,000
for their troubles. This is the fifth
cyber security settlement under the
False Claims Act in 2025.
Remember, CMMC verifies requirements
that are already in your contracts. So,
don't wait until you see a solicitation
with CMMC in it to get compliant. The
DOJ certainly isn't. And that's what
we're going to talk about today.
>> I mean, we were told at the beginning of
the year that there was a bunch of these
cases that potentially were going to be
unsealed and that they were just like
like a jack in the box like piled in the
box and we're just turning the crank
every single day to see what pops out
and if it's an FCA case and if the
clown's happy, sad or it got a 10%
discount because it turned itself in,
right? And so like here we are um where
it's a little bit different. It's not a
university. It's not a major, you know,
prime company or anything like that.
It's a smaller company. And again, I
said this before when we talked about
another FCA case of a small company.
It's one of the ones that people in the
DIP can look at and it looks more like
them. It's like what they look like in
the mirror, right?
>> Same scenario, same setup, not a lot of
contracts, right?
>> Yep. This was uh this was a 300 person
company and their $400,000 fine stems
from a handful of purchase orders that
they uh worked with. The employee was
like, "I don't feel comfortable with
what's going on here. We have
obligations. We're not meeting it." One
thing led to another and now they're
writing a check for way more than they
got paid on the actual purchase orders
thanks to the nature of the false claims
act. But let's just talk about the
settlement really quick. This comes
straight from the DOJ's press release.
The Department of Justice says the
settlement resolves allegations that
Swiss Automation caused the submission
of false claims by not providing
adequate cyber security to safeguard
company machined and supplied to defense
contractors. Swiss automation allegedly
knew that the requirement to provide
adequate security by implementing
certain cyber security controls applied
not only to DoD prime contractors but
also to subcontractors and suppliers to
those primes. the obligation to
implement security controls specified in
NIST SP8001 171 to protect certain DoD
information DOJ's words here has applied
to DoD contracts subcontracts and
similar contractual incidents since 2017
and will continue under the CMMC program
that DoD recently finalized. Couldn't
have said it better myself. We've said
this multiple times. CMMC is just the
verification for existing requirements
that have been in contracts for a long
time. Every DOJ settlement uh regarding
cyber security under the false claims
act, you know, is referring to
non-compliance with existing
requirements, nothing to do with CMMC.
>> Yeah. And so what we tend to see
sometimes in these cases, Jacob, is like
they'll be like, "Oh, we didn't know,
right? Remember we've been through that
with Stephanie and everything like that.
didn't know that excuse, but clearly in
the settlement it says that they knew
and that it just gross negligently
ignored it, right? Like so wouldn't you
think that the penalty would be much
harsher when that's the case than the
self-reporting organizations?
>> Yeah, I mean it I mean we'll have to,
you know, maybe talk to Stephanie again
or some folks that are familiar with it.
You know, the the nature of the fine is
highly variable, although it's always
significant. Uh, you know, the the trick
here though is that if you accept the
terms of the contract according to the
way the lawyers look at it, you know
that you have it in your contracts. If
you weren't aware of what you signed up
for in the contract, that's your
problem. That doesn't actually provide a
legal defense. Ask anybody who's
enlisted in the military. [laughter]
If you didn't know what was in your
contract, sorry about it. You don't
actually get to fly your own jet. you
get to handle a needle gun and knock
rust off the side of the ship instead.
Read your contracts, everybody. Uh
especially if you're gonna enlist in the
military. So,
>> just it's fascinating to see the
variance and there's no like method to
the madness exactly when it comes to
what these settlements equal up to. It's
like quarterback ranking, right? Like I
nobody knows exactly what that number
is.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, let's talk about the
False Claims Act just really quickly.
We've done multiple multiple episodes,
talked to multiple experts uh on the
False Claims Act. This is just a brief
primer off of the DOJ's website where
they talk about the False Claims Act.
Actually, they say the False Claims Act
is a federal statute originally enacted
in 1863
in response to defense contractor fraud
during the American Civil War. I mean,
this was straight up a thing that's been
around trying to get contractors that
are committing fraud. According to the
way the government views it, the False
Claims Act provides that any person who
knowingly, which is a specific legal
term, any person who knowingly submits
or causes to submit false claims to the
government is liable for three times the
government's damages plus a penalty that
is linked to inflation. Right? So this
is a highly variable uh set of fines
according to the value of the work
you're doing for the government. So the
size of the fines is determined by the
value of the contract, not the size of
the company. The Department of Justice
routinely goes after individuals for
fraud under the False Claims Act. So no
one is too small to be a target. Like we
said earlier, this is the fifth cyber
false claims act settlement in 2025 and
they have gone after everybody from mega
corporations to 100erson defense
subcontractors. So back in March, Morse
Corp got a $4.6 million settlement with
the False Claims Act. In May, Rathon and
Nightwing had an $ 8.4 million
settlement. Back in July, Aerero Turbine
$1.75 million. Recently in September,
Georgia Tech Research Corporation
settled for $875,000.
And now most recently in December
[clears throat] of 2025, Illinois
Precision 421 grand for their
settlements under the False Claims Act.
And then one of the other things to add
to that is that like in some cases
especially I think in Aerot Turbine
right it went to the PE firm right there
were other parties that were involved in
this like like you said they don't just
that they go after individuals for
fraud. Not just like a specific uh
>> Yeah.
>> Like there's nobody there's no
exclusions, right? There's nobody safe
if you're doing something wrong, I
guess, is what I was trying to get out.
>> The majority of False Claims Act cases
go after sort of healthc care fraud,
Medicare fraud, nursing homes, things
like that. Uh they can go after stuff
for uh during COVID, they had the uh I
think it was the paycheck protection
program or whatever.
>> Yeah. So there's lot going after
individuals committing fraud for that.
So, they go after gigantic corporations,
individuals, and everything in between.
But speaking of individuals, the thing
about the False Claims Act that should
really get your attention, uh, Mr. and
Mr. Defense Contractor out there is
there's a whistleblower provision in the
False Claims Act. So the DOJ says in
addition in addition to allowing the
United States to pursue perpetuators of
fraud on its own, the False Claims Act
allows private citizens to file suits on
behalf of the government against those
who have defrauded the government.
Private citizens who successfully uh you
know execute these actions may receive a
portion of the government's recovery, 10
to 30% of the fine. So, you're going to
take the value of all the contracts that
you have submitted a false claim for.
They're going to hit you for triple the
value of that work, and then the
whistleblower will get paid out 10 to
30% of those fines. So, for example,
Morris Corp, $4.6 million settlement.
The relator, the whistleblower got 18.5%
of that $4.6 million. And Morris Corp
had to pay almost $200,000
for the whistleblowers legal fees.
Rathon and Nightwing $8.4 million
settlement. The whistleblower got paid a
million and a half bucks. Aeroturbine
$1.75 million settlement. They
self-reported their non-compliance and
the false claim because their private
equity firm, like you said, is actually
the one that committed the violation and
got them in trouble. They turned
themselves in and still had to pay
almost $2 million in fines. Georgia
Tech, like we talked about earlier,
$875,000
settlements, $21,000
to the whistleblower. And then finally,
Illinois Precision, $421,000.
had to pay their quality manager, not
even the IT guy, the quality manager who
blew the whistle, 65 grand for the
trouble of letting the government know
that you're not doing the things that
you're supposed to be doing inside your
contract.
>> What are some things that affect that
percentage that you get? Or is it just
at the end of the day they're just like,
you know what, this sounds like you gave
us 18.5%,
you know, worth of evidence for this
case. Is that what it is?
>> Yeah, I'm not sure. We'd love to, you
know, in the new year have some people
on uh who are more familiar, have
Stephanie back and have some other folks
back as well that can maybe shed some
light on why you're sometimes get 10,
sometimes you get 30. Either way, uh you
know, the people who are blowing the
whistle are not making a million and a
half bucks a year. I mean, you're
talking about people who are getting a
massive windfall when they otherwise
would have just preferred to probably do
their job. Uh and we've talked to a lot
of these whistleblowers before. every
one of them that blew the whistle and
got this massive payday are still
employed to this day. So, it's not like
they have trouble finding work
afterwards. Uh, just, you know, so
you're aware, probably the biggest
insider risk that you have inside of
your company if you're not compliant
with your contractual requirements are
your own employees because they are
highly incentivized to blow the whistle
and go after this payday. It's just
business at the end of the day. uh be
aware, right? Out of the out of the five
cyber security false claims act
settlements this year, four of them had
whistleblowers walk away with a ton of
money.
>> Yeah. I mean, it's just a case of see
something, say something, and the
government can't see everything. So that
they're hoping that somebody says
something, and obviously you're going to
get rewarded if you say something and it
leads to something.
>> Yeah, absolutely. So, if you're not
familiar, we did an entire episode
outlining the basics of DFARS clause
252204712.
The entire CMMC program exists for the
most part to verify that you are
complying with that clause specifically
because of situations like this. There
is no inherent proof to the government
that you're complying with it. They're
just taking your attestation. They're
just taking your word that you are
complying with it. So if you handle
control DOD information on your
information system, then you operate
what is known as a covered contractor
information system. Pursuant to DAR's
clause 252204712,
if you submit invoices without complying
with DAR 712, you are making a false
claim to the government. Previous false
claims act cases have held that cyber
security compliance is material to the
contract. Talking Aerojet rocket dine
here several years ago. Therefore, the
government can easily come after you for
treble damages for triple the value of
the actual contract that you signed with
them. So from this most recent
settlement, Assistant Attorney General
Brett Schumate of the Department of
Justice Civil Division said, "We will
continue our efforts to hold defense
contractors, subcontractors, and
suppliers accountable when they fail to
honor their DoD cyber security
commitments." And then we will hold
suppliers accountable when they fall
short of their cyber security
obligations to the Department of
Defense. That was special agent in
charge Jason Sarenski. He's the DoD IG
from the Defense Criminal Investigative
Service. They all say the same thing,
right? You get the IG's from the
components, you get the people from DOJ.
They're like, "You have these
obligations. You don't do it. We're
coming after you." I I just this is just
simple transactional like adequate
adequate right like it I pay you for
something I expect you to be doing
exactly the specifications I pay you to
lay a floor you know I expect you to put
the sublining underneath the floor to
make sure it doesn't get like these are
the things that we pay for so it's just
making sure that you live up to the
expectations of what you sign for and it
seems to be a concept that is missed by
many right like I it's just
>> I mean you know one of the things that
we've heard for years. One of the things
we still hear to this day, people hate
it whenever people tell them that
they've had these obligations in their
contracts all along. They think it's
annoying. They think that it's besides
the point. They don't like it. They find
it's grading. That's totally fine. The
DOJ doesn't care, right? And a lot of
times people go, "This is just fear,
uncertainty, and doubt." We got half a
dozen of these things just this year
alone. People are paying out hundreds of
thousands, millions of dollars in fines.
There's certainly going to be more next
year in 2026. So, it's only FUD if it's
not true. Go talk to Mr. Schumate or Mr.
Serjenski about whether or not I didn't
know that I had this in my contract is a
reasonable defense. They're going to
settle with you for millions of dollars
potentially.
>> It's only fun if there's not fuel for
the fire of the purpose, right? The
purpose here is to protect the
information so we don't have Korean jets
flying around looking like ours. Hey, I
mean, you know, you can extrapolate it
to as big of a picture as you want to,
but at the end of the day, it's a term
in the contract that you signed up for.
You submit an invoice and you didn't do
what's in the contract and the
government has every, you know, avenue
to come after you for making a false
claim. They've been doing this since
1863. So, you got to take it up with
them. But ju just as zoom out on the
False Claims Act here at the end, this
is big business for the government. The
Department of Justice, according to
their stats, obtained more than $2.9
billion dollar in settlements and
judgments from civil cases involving
fraud and false claims against the
government just in fiscal year 2025.
That is an insane amount of money. Like
I said, a very tiny fraction so far has
been from cyber civil fraud. Back in
2021, the Department of Justice launched
their cyber civil fraud initiative. Back
then, they said, "We will use our civil
enforcement tools to pursue companies,
those who are government contractors who
receive federal funds when they fail to
follow required cyber security standards
because we know that puts all of us at
risk. This is a tool that we have to
ensure that taxpayer dollars are used
appropriately to guard the public uh
trust and public taxpayer dollars. So,
uh that was back in 2021 and now every
year we've seen more and more of these
false claims act settlements. They take
a while to work through the system ramp
up and up and up and up and up. Right?
CMMC is its own thing that the DoD is
doing. false claims, cyber civil fraud.
That is DOJ's own thing. They're
related, not the same thing. So, uh, a
lot of people are like, "This seems
very, um, unlikely. Seems like it
doesn't come up very often." I'll just
tell you from my experience, over the
last two years, every time I post a
settlement regarding cyber false claims,
they outperform the rest of my posts on
LinkedIn by probably a factor of 10. It
gets everybody's eyeballs. It gets
everybody's attention. So, you know,
we're all amongst friends here. You
don't have to say that it's the thing
that uh freaks you out the most. We
already know. So, you know, so you're
aware these things are real. They are
absolutely happening. The DOJ is very
interested in your compliance with
DR712.
Even if you're not all that interested
in pursuing CMMC certification, the more
you know,
>> 2.9 2.9 billion last year, they're just
scratching the surface. And they haven't
even unsealed all the ones that they
know for sure, right? Like what an
emerging line of business, I guess, is
the way you could put it.
>> Yeah, absolutely. It's uh it, you know,
also just as taxpayers, right? They're
recovering $2.9 billion in fines for
things that people got paid for and they
didn't do. So, uh you know, that's also
something to think about just uh just as
we enter into the holiday season here,
everybody. But there you go. Uh we're at
uh we're at five for the year. I predict
we're going to have more than that in
2026. What do you think? Do you think
the DOJ is right here? Do you think the
False Claims Act is a thing that should
exist? Do you think we're going to see
more? Are you surprised we didn't see
more in 2025? Let us know in the
comments. Like and subscribe. We'll see
you next week.
