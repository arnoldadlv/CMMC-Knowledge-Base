All right, folks. It is December of
2025. It's almost the end of the year,
which is so crazy because I remember
back in January when things were uh
there were memos and fed ramp
equivalency and all this craziness.
Anyways, it's the end of the year. Show
goes on. Since the 48 CFR CMC final rule
was published in September of 2025, we
have seen supplier notices, supplier
letters, webinars from Lockheed, RTX,
BAE, HII, ABCD, EFG, you name it. All
the primes are putting out supplier
notices telling people that CMC is here
and it is now officially a real problem.
Most recently, Northrup Grumman
published a supplier announcement titled
CMMC 2.0 is final. Are you ready? The
bottom line, ain't nobody getting a
waiver for CMMC. And this week, we're
going to talk about why.
>> It's uh very heartening to see now that
somebody needs to take leadership. The
people that are kind of in charge of all
the contracts are stepping up and
saying, "Hey, are you aware of this
thing?" taking some sort of leadership.
What's going on with your CMC progress?
I just don't know if the people that
they're taking leadership over are
prepared for what's coming uh to them.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Generally, anecdotally, it
seems like most of the dib is not ready,
but I think that the we have definitely
seen a big uptick in inquiries around
CMMC thanks to the primes letters more
than any of the rulemaking milestones.
That's the way it works. That's totally
fine. Let's get into the letter and and
>> as they say when big alphabet gets
involved everybody needs to pay
attention right like same thing when it
comes to contracting
>> absolutely final rule comes out goes
into effect you know crickets locked
sends a letter everybody you know
scrambles so anyways first things first
if your prime needs CMMC you need CMMC
so directly from the 32 CFR program rule
32 CFR 170 if you Google it uh that went
into effect a year ago, December of
2024, as North points out in their
letter. Specifically, section 170.23A3,
application to subcontractors.
If a subcontractor will process, sore,
or transmit CUI and performance of the
subcontract and the associated prime
contract has a requirement for a CMMC
status of level 2C3 PAO, which means you
had to go out and hire a third party to
conduct your assessment. then the status
of CMMC level 2C3 PAO is the minimum
requirement for the subcontractor. So
the easiest way to answer the question
of whether you will need CMMC level 2C3
PAO status and whether you will have to
go out and hire a third party to conduct
your assessment is if your prime
customer requires CMC level 2C3 PAO
status and if your prime customer is
Lockheed BAE HI Northrup ABCD EFG the
answer is yes they will need CMC level
2C3 PAO because they are certainly going
to handle at least once some level of
CUI that requires that level of
assurance. That's kind of the end of the
story for that one.
>> Yeah, I there there's been absolutely no
way to dodge it. It just seems that even
if you are on one contract in which
maybe you get this glimmer of hope where
you're not going to need the C3PAO,
every other contract that you're on, the
likelihood is that small minuscule uh
probability that's not going to happen.
>> Yeah, absolutely. So, moving on through
the announcement, your prime can't wave
your CMC requirement. So if they require
it, you require it. If you require it,
they can't wave it. So from the Northrep
letter, neither contracting officers nor
prime contractors may wave or deviate
from the CMMC cyber security control and
assessment requirements directly from
the 32 CFR program rule that's been in
effect for a year now. Section 170.5
policy. In very limited circumstances
and in accordance with all applicable
policies, procedures, and requirements,
a service acquisition executive or
component acquisition executive in the
DoD may elect to wave inclusion of CMC
program requirements in a solicitation
or contract. In such cases, contractors
and subcontractors will remain obligated
to comply with all applicable cyber
security and information security
requirements. They're talking about FAR
clause 5220421
and DVARS clause 252204712
and 7020. We recently wrapped up our
back to basics series where we walk
through the text of all those clauses.
If somehow there is a waiver for CMMC,
you still have the obligations under
those FAR and DEFARS clauses to
implement cyber security. So don't make
the uh the the common mistake of
conflating the CMMC assessment program
with the requirements that are still in
your contract. The
>> there there's nothing to to really be
said about this, Jacob. It is just
carrying out what has to be done as per
the rules. and it's a prime contractor
uh who we've said multiple times the DoD
doesn't have any um necessarily grip on
exactly how they're going to patrol
their supply chain and this is them
telling you that we're carrying out the
the letter of the law to the exact
letter right
>> yeah exactly and so there are two CMMC
rules as we all know there's one program
implemented by two rules so we had the
32 rule a year ago
>> it gets implemented in contracts with
the 48 CFR rule that's the actual text
of the contract clauses that takes that
program policy and converts it into
contract clause language that just went
into effect in November uh November 10th
of 201 uh10. And so they describe the
waiver process. They say first of all
that's the 32 rule and that was a year
ago. But in the preamble to that 48 CFR
rule, they say waiverss are at the
discretion of the program office or
requiring activity and they are
determined prior to, which we're going
to talk about later, prior to the
contracting officer's involvement in the
procurement. This is why Northrup's
letter says we the prime and the
contracting officer don't control the
waiverss. It happens before they're
involved.
>> Yeah. I mean, so basically this is them
telling their their supply chain, hey, I
know that you may think that this may
not apply to you or you don't want this
to apply to you, but we don't control
whether it applies to you or not. It's
being told to us from above that we have
to carry this out, right?
>> If it applies to them, it applies to
you. And if it applies to them and it
applies to you, they can't wave it for
you. So, it applies to you.
>> So, this is kind of more like, hey,
don't come at us. Like, we're just doing
what we're told to do, right? They're
just uh they're just following orders if
you Yeah. So [laughter]
>> So moving on. Another reminder about
waivers. They are for entire contracts,
not for individual contractors. So I've
been memeing it up on LinkedIn this week
talking about this Northrup letter and
somebody asked the question. They said,
"Well, okay, it's it's a
pre-solicitation process and you got to
request a waiver. How many organizations
do you think are going to get waivers?"
And I'm like, "No, no, no. You don't
understand. Organizations don't get
waivers. the entire contract is waved of
the requirements. So, from a memo that
was released in January of 2025, which
we've done previous episodes on, we'll
link it below. This was after the 32 CFR
program rule came out. A bunch of the
under secretaries of defense took that
guidance, wrote a memo to the
acquisition workforce, and uh part of
that memo is called implementing the
CMMC program process for waving CMMC
assessment requirements. And in that
memo, it says, "Program managers or
requiring activities may request service
acquisition executive or component
acquisition executive approval to wave
CMC assessment requirements." That's
what the rule says. All CMC waiver
requests must be coordinated through the
components chief information officer
prior to this uh service or component
acquisition executive approval. The
waivers may be requested and approved
for an individual procurement or an
entire class of procurements. The
waivers will only impact whether COC
assessments will be included in
solicitation documents, not the actual
def cyber security requirements that are
in there. So there's a whole like maze
of bureaucracy that has to happen before
the solicitation ever goes out. So, the
program office has to coordinate with
their service CIO, which reports to the
DoD CIO. And as we know, the DoD CIO is
what runs the CMMC program. So, they're
probably not super eager to wave the
requirements. If you get past that
hurdle, then it goes up to a service or
component acquisition executive who
makes a decision. Am I going to remove
the CMC assessment requirement for every
contractor and subcontractor underneath
this contract?
>> So, you're telling me if the waiver were
to be granted to the entirety of a
contract, it would have to go through
two layers of somebody deciding that
this doesn't have to be there. At least
>> at least. Yeah. At least. And remember,
this is, you know, who's not included in
that chain of events? Northrep. which is
why their letter says we don't grant the
waiverss. Uh that's a process that
happens before we ever touch this. So,
>> and then from your from what you know,
like those two people that would have to
say, "Hey, let's remove this." Those
would be the same two people that would
make the decision whether to include it,
right? Like Yeah. So, like they may have
already come to the decision that we
want to include this. And then somebody
says, "Hey, can you double check this?"
And they're like, "No, we already
reviewed it." Right.
>> Yeah. Like we talked about in our 48 CFR
CMC rule webinar, the contracting
officer just fills in the blank of the
contract clause that says you require
XYZ CMMC level. They're told by the
program office what that level is going
to be. They don't decide what the level.
So the program office has to say it
needs a waiver. They got to go to the
component CIO that needs a waiver.
They're almost certainly going to ask
the DoD CIO. Then it has to go to a
component or a service level acquisition
executive. As we have talked to many
former contracting officers on this
podcast and at various conferences like
CS2 in the past, it's not something that
contracting officers and program
managers are eager to do. They're not
eager to go knock on the door of the big
boss and say, "I need an exception."
>> I don't think it's like something that
regularly happens either.
>> No. Uh you're not getting a waiver,
right? So in in this in this memo in
this memo they go on to say CMMC level
one no waiverss CMC level two self
assessment a lot of people are breathing
a sigh of relief at the idea that they
might get a self- assessment uh first of
all those will be less and less common
as time goes on but there's also no
waiverss for CMMC level two self
assessment which is very interesting you
might be able to get a waiver for CMC
level 2 C3PAO assessments but as the
memo says these will quote be rare
error. They are not for clear defense
contractors and approved waiverss on a
class basis. So for an entire class of
procurements must include a planned
expiration date. So these are temporary
and guidance for requiring CMMC
certification in subsequent
solicitations. So it's only the first
round of awards that goes out. In all
such cases, as the memo says, the
solicitation must include a requirement
to submit alternate protection plans for
securing FCI and CUI. Uh, and the
alternate protection plans must be
evaluated as part of the selection
process. This is exactly like poams,
right? This is exactly like plans of
action milestones. They do technically
exist in CMMC, but not really. Waivers
do technically exist, but you're not
getting one.
Is there a case where uh a waiver would
come like posts solicitation like uh
like stringent circumstances?
>> Yeah. So, you know, we'd have to wait
and see if this happens. So, if they
make the decision that there's a
requirement and it goes out in the
solicitation and then it does turn out
that there aren't enough companies who
can meet that requirement, then they
have to reissue the solicitation with
that requirement waved. We haven't seen
that happen yet. I'm sure it's going to
happen at least once. Um but yeah that
that could happen afterwards
>> but the inclusion of the requirements in
the solicitation is an evaluation of
risk on the DoD's part.
>> Correct.
>> What if uh the evaluation of the risk of
that solicitation which they say we need
to retract those requirements from is
outside the appetite of the DoD.
>> Uh then they don't retract the
requirement and it stays in the
solicitation. It's condition of contract
award
>> and and just there's just not enough
people to meet it. It's just whoever
gets to meet it or
>> Well, this is the thing is the number of
people who you need to qualify to bid on
the contract is a pretty small number,
right? They don't need 900 companies to
submit bids. They need like nine
companies to have a minimum number of
bids to review to pick who to award to.
So, you don't need that many companies
to compete uh for a solicitation for the
DoD to say we have enough companies to
compete for the solicitation. So for the
sake of inclusion or for the sake of
breaking down barriers or walls of
inclusion into the contracting base,
you're saying that the DoD is not going
to adjust their risk appetite.
>> Uh well, this is the thing is when we
talk about DoD's risk appetite, what
ends up happening is people talk about
the DoD as if it's one giant entity,
right? Risk appetites are going to be
different from program manager to
program manager, component to component,
activity to activity, uh you know,
service to service, program to program.
It's going to it's going to vary widely.
We've heard uh and for the
subcontractors listening, it's going to
vary from prime to prime, purchaser to
purchaser, right? So, it's too difficult
to predict broadly what the DoD is going
to do uh versus what is going to happen
with an individual circumstance, which
is why we tell everybody the best thing
you can do is talk to your customer
because unless your customer has reached
out to you and say, "Hey, we got it.
Don't worry about it. We got resources.
We got time. We got waiverss. We got
this. We're going to hook you up." You
need to be really worried if you're
hoping for those things and you haven't
heard about them yet.
>> Yeah, my bad to derail, but no question
stuck here.
>> Yeah. So, moving on here, a reminder,
right? Waivers are a pre-solicitation
process. So from the 32 CFR rule section
170.3 applicability application of COC
program requirements to a procurement or
class of procurements may be waved in
advance of the solicitation at the
discretion of the DoD in accordance with
all the relevant policies and procedures
from the 32 CFR final rule preamble.
Once applicable to a solicitation, there
is no process for organizations to seek
waiverss of CMC requirements from the
DoD CIO. A lot of people are out there
and they have been saying, "We don't
think that this is a real issue. We
don't think that this is a real
requirement. We're not going to start
working on CUMMC until we see it in a
solicitation." Once you see it in a
solicitation, it has been determined
there will be enough companies to meet
the requirement that there aren't going
to be waiverss for that contract. So, if
you are hoping that you'll see it in the
solicitation and then get special
exceptions, you are too late. So, if
you're waiting until you see CMMC in a
solicitation to consider it a real
requirement, you're just burning time.
>> And that's not just for the
implementation part of it, right? Like
the implementation part of it, it's
completely impossible. But let's just
say naively they are thinking that we
aren't going to do anything towards the
actual CMC stuff which is the C3PAO
evaluation right we aren't going to
pursue that until we see it in the
solicitation even then it's not enough
time
>> well this is the thing right is what
people are really saying is we're not
going to get started on complying with
DAR's 7012 requirements until we know
that there's going to be a third party
assessment
>> that's why I threw the naive in there
right like naive I'd like to think like
25% of those people are like me
man. We're just not going to get to
come.
>> That's what they're really saying.
However, like the memo and the rules
say, even if there is a waiver for a COC
assessment requirement, DAR 712 still
applies to you, right? So waiting to see
if the third party assessment
requirement is going to be there to get
started on the thing that it they are
verifying is honestly the reason why COC
is a program in the first place. And as
we just talked about last week on the
show, that 7012 ex, you know,
requirement still exists and dip will
come knocking for whenever, no matter
what you're using, DOJ issues, you got
all kinds of other issues uh to to worry
about. Absolutely. All right, so just
wrapping up here. All of this is a
condition of contract awards. So, from
Northw's letter, contracting officers
may not award contracts to non-compliant
contractors and prime contractors may
not award purchase orders to
non-compliant subcontractors.
And then they nicely say, "We encourage
you to proactively prepare to comply
with this future contractual
requirement." [laughter]
Understatement of the decade, Northrup,
like nudge.
>> Encourage you to proactively prepare.
Yeah. Uh, you should be proactively
preparing. Uh
>> that's like when your parents say like I
suggest that you do this or I see you
know like
>> I would I would strongly suggest you
clean your room. Yeah. You don't
>> strongly advise against you doing that.
>> You're out. Yeah. Your your your suit
would look a lot better with a tie. That
means put a tie on. Right. Yeah.
[laughter]
>> So So last idea here. So why are they
making this announcement now? Right. Why
is Northrep why are all these supplier
announcements coming out? We knew this
was coming. We know what the
requirements are. for like it's been the
simplest thing to predict is we've been
doing it for a couple years now. Uh as
Northrup says at the bottom of their
letter starting on November 10th, 2025,
contracting officers may add the DFAR's
clauses to solicitations and contracts
with immediate compliance requirements.
We are in the phase roll out. We are in
phase one of CMMC as it is going into
contracts since November 10th. It's free
game, which means as Northrup starts to
see solicitations and opportunities that
they work on, which they work on those
opportunities for months and months,
sometimes years before those
solicitations start to come together.
They're going to know ahead of time. We
need suppliers who need it, which is why
they're sending out the letters now
encouraging you to proactively prepare
to comply,
>> which it's a great defense against those
people that are saying, "I'll wait until
I see CMMC in a solicitation." Because
now you're seeing a prime contractor
saying we nudge nudge encourage you to
get on top of this and
>> the rules are done. The rules are in
effect. Phase roll out is in effect. The
primes have sent out the letters or
seeing sam.gov
>> immediate compliance requirement sticks
out in that whole statement, right? Like
we're not we're not taking a slow roll
>> at at this point. What else do you need
to know besides getting the knock on
your door at that point? Like we're
talking about you just wasted a bunch of
time that you could have been using to
get ready. So take Northrup's advice and
proactively prepare to comply and uh
then take our advice, like and subscribe
and then we'll see you next week.
>> See you next week.
