## Transcript

[Music]
all right folks it is December and we
are here with the Great and Powerful
Fernando Machado give it up for Fernando
the best and busiest C3 Pao that we know
of uh Fernando how's it going man it's
going good man thanks for having me yeah
I you know this is uh the first time
that we've had you on the show which is
actually kind of crazy because you're
one of the cmmc O's you and I both
presented at CS2 San Diego all the way
back in uh 2021 the end of 2021 so you
and I have been around Jason you were
there we were all hanging out in San
Diego we've been around the block a
couple times as far as CMC goes uh but
for those of you uh our audience that
aren't familiar if they haven't somehow
come across your content on LinkedIn and
elsewhere uh who are you what do you do
uh what what should they know about you
so uh I'm a authorized cmmc third party
assessment
organization um when the Cyber
accreditation body was first stood up
back in 2020 we joined the then AB
standard management industry working
group uh so been involved from the very
beginning uh was one of the first
provisional assessors uh I'm provisional
assessor number eight uh and then we
became or the 29th authorized C3PO back
in 2022 and we've just we've just been
cranking out jsv ever since then yeah
yeah you guys have been man it's been
super busy I think I was like
provisional Assessor 25 or something
like that so uh yeah Fernando definitely
knows his stuff he's definitely been
around uh Jason's here too what's going
on man we usually have three people so
I'm a little rusty it's the holidays
it's the end of the year Jason how's it
going no it's going good I think that
there's an easy explanation there's a
couple things that he omitted from his
background um meme generator
extraordinaire um I think that we need
to point out that uh the ability of
Fernando to create great memes is there
he's also a published author so you know
see him book um and probably the only
person that I've never seen standing in
the same spot at the same time um
especially ever since he got Gucci
loafers and I feel like that he's
walking and now he stands with his feet
out so people see the Gucci loafers but
this is great for me I can't believe
it's took this long to get you on the
show yeah man I'm happy to be here it's
uh been a hot minute since uh since uh
San CS2 San Diego yeah it's been a while
and and there's too much there's too
much Beltway Centric uh you know stuffy
DC suits at these events we need more
south Florida flavor and that's what you
bring to the table Fernando the loafers
the white Blazer I love it I love it
can't get enough but this week this week
we're gonna talk about the thing that
everybody is talking about right you are
a C3 Pao you have been running joint
surveillance assessments tons of them
you have a huge backlog of clients that
want cmmc assessments you've seen it
you've done it all shapes and sizes as
far as assessment goes so we got some
questions that we're going to run
through and uh we'll get your take on
them I'm sure we're not going to get
through all the questions that we
possibly could this is going to have to
be a multi-part series but we'll get the
ball rolling and uh we'll jump into it
uh Jason you want to kick us off yeah so
I think that if we we talked about
assessments and we kind of compared it I
would go to Cal Ripken to see how to
stay healthy to continuously be in the
starting lineup and then I would go to
Fernando to say you know through jsv
what kind of are some of the things that
you have seen that have separated the
successful and the unsuccessful alike
yeah so the biggest thing is preparation
right so companies that have gone
through successful assessments have come
to us with good documentation I.E very
wellestablished policies procedures
artifacts work instructions which then
kind of leads to detailed documentation
like system security plans although it's
not required typically the more
successful companies have documented
their system security plans out to the
assessment objective level so that
clearly identifies to us like where to
go find things and to clearly delineate
to the assessor where things are at um
having a good shared a customer
responsibility Matrix right for the
services that they're inheriting either
from any external service providers that
they have uh and then most importantly
document traceability Matrix right don't
just dump a whole bunch of documents
policies and procedures in our lap and
not tell us how things are connected to
each other so you know it's interesting
you said say that so is it um can you
tell whenever you're working with a
company if they're giving you sort of
templated policies and procedures versus
a company that's giving you something
that they actually use themselves that
they're familiar with is it is it
obvious whenever you're talking with
them yeah sometimes they'll show us
their their you know policies and
procedures and I mean there's nothing
wrong with using templates that the
biggest problem is when they don't
modify those templates to their
environment and we sometimes see things
like you know brackets insert company
name here or we'll see brackets you know
some University that they pick something
up from offline and we're like yeah this
is not going to work for you guys now I
that that that leads me to a good
question is that a case where like even
if the policy actually does clearly
explain what the organization has going
on right like it it does its purpose but
it has something like that left in there
is that a discrepancy is that something
that you mark as a deficiency that needs
to be corrected uh it it depends on if
it affects the assessment objective of
that control okay and so and by
assessment objective you're talking
about the 320 criteria in sp800
171a rather than just the 110 things in
sp800 171 correct that is correct that
is correct so so so if somebody were to
you know if you were to start talking
with a potential client for assessment
and they said yeah I mean most of it's
in our guys head but they're really
smart we know what's going on uh we
don't have everything documented is I
mean is that sufficient for getting
through an assessment if if I know all
the answers and they're just in my mind
uh is that good enough no uh so so short
answer is no uh because if if you look
at how 171 the short answer is no and
the long answer is
no yeah so a lot of the uh the you'll
notice a lot of like 171 and 171 uh 171a
specifically how structured is there's
typically some type of documentation
that is referenced and then there is
followed by some type of technical
configuration that comes after that so
if it's all in your head you're probably
not gonna pass right right exactly so
you know I just have a related question
I guess with what Jason kicked off there
we were talking about what separates
successful and unsuccessful companies
but within the realm of companies who
are successful going through assessments
what you know what are they doing
consistently to achieve these one
perfect 110 scores because there's been
a lot of companies that have gone
through jsv that have sailed through
with like perfect scores so what are the
ones that are are knocking it out of the
park on the first try what are they
doing consistently not that the
companies that have poams that
eventually get to 110 aren't doing a
good job but you know what are the
companies that are are are getting it
right the first time what are they doing
consistently that you've seen what are
the commonalities yeah the the biggest
interconnecting tissue that we've seen
is that these companies are using very
good consultants and external service
providers and a lot of them are some of
the same folks that have been in the
space from the very beginning and been
around for a long time and they have a
very good understanding the requirements
of walking these con uh contractors
through what the controls are what the
intended purpose is and as well as a lot
of them actually have dipac experience
having gone through um dipac High
assessments yeah yeah have you seen um
yeah we talk about the importance of
partnering with people who know what's
going on all the time have you come
across situations where um you know
people were partnered with an MSP or
somebody who maybe was less familiar
with the requirements like is that is
that also an obvious thing whenever you
start walking through the situation here
yeah sometimes they'll they'll come to
us and you know we get the typical uh
you know or MSP will handle everything
I'm like will they though I mean this is
kind of a sheer responsibility
uh and so we start to we start to you
know ask those questions on you know
who's responsible for what and when I
hear the osc say the you know the Mana
service provider is responsible for
everything I'm like yeah this is not
going to end well for you so yeah
probably gonna have to pass on this yeah
yeah so um yeah I I I just kind of want
to overlap on to kind of what Jacob said
the things that you see successful but I
more so some of the things that you do
see like you have um done enough of
these gsva assessments to this point to
where you can kind of formulate a
Fernando's top 10 most other than
satisfied controls right um is there any
controls in specific that stand out to
you and is there any overlap with them
with the information that we've been
provided by Nick Del Roso and the people
at dipk through their reports yeah uh
believe it or not it the top two
controls that we see are fips validated
cryptography which should be of no
surprise to anybody if you're in the in
the dib and multiactor
authentication um primarily what ends up
happening on the fifth side is
contractors like I always you know
firewalls are always the first thing
that I always see as a primary example
of where they'll just implement the
firewall with the latest and greatest
firmware and then forget to actually put
that firewall into fips mode with the
correct firmware of where it's supposed
to be um and then of course failing
things like multiactor authentication
and they'll apply MFA in one area but
not another
and we always tell them right the
requirements apply to the systems that
process store transmit cui or that
provide security protection for those
components so those are the that that's
typically the biggest um the two top
controls that we see that are failed for
those reasons yeah what are the sorry
real quick just to double on that um
what in the in the case of MFA what what
do you feel is the biggest blindsiding
element of a information system that an
organization is seeing that oh I need
MFA there like I didn't know that
uh the the the firewall uh is the
biggest area um they think you know I'm
I'm just putting you know MFA on my
laptop that should be good enough and
they don't realize that there's a whole
gamut of different areas that they have
to put MFA on uh for you know privileged
non-privileged accounts you know Network
and then local access are are the top
key areas that we look at yeah so I mean
is it more of a is it more of an MFA
reluctance thing or is it more of a
scoping misunderstanding thing I think
it's a scoping misunderstanding they
like oh we applied it here oh I didn't
realize that we needed to apply it there
I'm like yeah you need to apply it there
and we reference him back to paragraph
1.1 of 171 yeah you know because you
know I mean I can't drop my dog off at
Doggy Daycare without logging in with
MFA so it seems like the technical
barrier to things like that are it's an
interesting contrast because something
like fips validated cryptography there a
lot more in the weeds there's issues you
got to look up modules and stuff like
that but something like MFA is
relatively trivial to deploy you know
for a lot of systems and and and issues
these days so they feel like they're two
very different situations um yeah so
it's interesting to hear that it's more
of a scoping thing and then more of a a
fips validated thing I guess that that
brings me to my next question so on the
whole you know outside of the top two
but on the whole would you say that the
bigger hurdle for organizations are
technical requirements or what you might
refer to as non-technical requirements
because you know we see a lot of
companies Outsource the technical work
to these managed service providers and
so they're kind of offloading a lot of
the technical work and they still in our
experience stumble with the
non-technical uh issues the ones they're
responsible for so what what have you
seen yeah I've seen uh the biggest
hurdle that we've seen is the
non-technical requirements um a lot of
them like to your point they'll
Implement all of the technical aspects
of their environment and but they don't
document anything so yeah it's difficult
to show our assessment team any of the
evidence that they say that they've done
yeah I mean you got to you got to show
your work on the math problem right I
mean it's like you got the right answer
on the question but you got to be able
to show your work to prove how you got
it this is an assurance function this is
sort of proving to other people that you
have done it rather than just proving to
yourself that's the whole that's the
whole point so that that sort of matches
with what we've seen as well so kind of
to that point um you said it was the
non-technical requirements and the fail
in the document Jacob is uh a term or
you know has attempted to get get
momentum with a term called false starts
when it comes to cmmc assessments I
don't know if you're familiar with it or
not um but essentially it is yeah tell
your friends okay yeah so the
pre-assessment packet with the
documentation that defends the
implementations is delivered to the C3
Pao prior to the assessment kicking off
and then at that point in time the C3PO
the lead assessor um makes the
determination right that this can go or
noo into an assessment right you are
good and documented I want to ask you
are those a real thing right how common
are those and you know is that a case
where the documentation is just
absolutely not there or just not like up
to Snuff yeah so we've had to turn
companies away um for both jsv and cmmc
scheduling due to a variety of reasons
uh it'll be things like abnormally short
system security plans uh you know when
your SSP is 12 Pages probably not going
to you're probably not going to make it
out of the gate very far um controls not
address to the assessment objective
level uh which is crazy right because
we've been screaming from the rooftops
over the last several years I know you
have Jacob right about that was what I
presented on at CS2 San Diego in 2021
was that exact thing was that 171a
exists yeah it continues to keep you
know evading some some customers they
download 171 and not address it down to
the assessment objective level and then
sometimes we've had to turn
organizations away for leveraging nonfed
rant moderate cloud service providers or
even equivalent so you know most
commonly right Microsoft 365 commercial
and then when we tell them like yeah
you're probably not going to pass you
know here's a list of you know some
trusted external service providers that
we work with you know and come back and
see us in a few months yeah so you know
talking about the external service
provider thing you were talking about
you know the people who seem to fly
through at the best scores work with
these external providers that know what
they're talking about how how important
is that in the situation because you
know we've you we obviously sell manag
services and when we talk to people you
know this is you know we're telling them
the truth is that for a lot of the
companies in the dib that don't have the
internal resources they don't have the
internal expertise they kind of have to
partner with somebody who knows how to
do these things outside of their company
because they just they can't do it inous
how how important is that would you say
in the in the cross-section of companies
that you work with a lot of the
companies youve worked with are early
adopters jvas and things like that but
we can probably extrapolate into the the
future set of companies you what what
role does the MSP play in an assessment
what is that like yeah so usually those
are they're pretty vital to a
contractor's success I mean we had an
assessment that was fully supported by
an MSP and it was amazing because they
clearly laid out their individual
responsibilities for each control I.E
via their customer and shareed
responsibility Matrix and you know I've
always said I mean I know we've had this
conversation many times Jacob where I
think msps are Force multipliers for
better worse as you know time goes on
and although the cmmc rule doesn't
require msps to get assessed the rule
suggests like you know knock on wood
suggests that they do get assessed
voluntarily to reduce the msp's efforts
required during the contractor's
assessment yeah I mean does that in your
opinion does that does that facilitate
things that smooth things out I mean you
know if you've seen a if you've worked
with the MSP before and they've gone
through their CT and you've seen how
they operate like does that does that
make stuff smoother and faster and
easier yeah it makes it makes it
smoother because like now the MSP
doesn't have to be at the table because
they've already been certified and it it
just basically only now relegates things
to the contractor's side of the table
Yeah so so just to jump in and clarify
like what you just said right like a
certified MSP gives a standard level of
assurance to the assessor right um that
you know this what they do on the back
end is defended because it is certified
right and so they would not have to
present I don't know a staff member to
defend the implementations on behalf of
uh the the OC or the Osa um and when
we're talking about things here you're
talking about saving you know some money
on the cost of services from the MSP or
whatever it is but in addition to that
you're talking about um the cost of the
hourly rate that it may take for a
specialist to come out and you know
deliver that type of service to you the
time of materials rate but also the
amount of money that you're going to
have to pay not only to the C3PO the
first time around but at recertification
and things like that correct yep yeah it
it saves it saves a lot of time right if
if you're able to demonstrate uh that
inheritance it it saves a ton of time uh
for for the contractor yeah sure so
talking about time um
Fernando um right now and we talk about
this all the time but right now for you
for your organization what does the
backlog for CMC assessments like if I
were to come to you and say hey I need
to get assessed when could you fit me on
the calendar yeah so our first
availability right now is uh we're
starting in August of next year August
of 2025
correct good grief son so I mean you
guys are not necessar you're not a
oneman operation yeah and you're not a
one team operation run an assessment you
run an assessment organization you have
multiple assessors who work for you and
so you know it's not like you're busy
until August your whole team is busy
until August team is busy through August
of next year so I mean how I mean okay
so there that seems like there's a lot
of companies calling you in order to try
to get scheduled until August correct I
mean what's the what what is it like on
your end for when the phone rings I mean
you're hearing from all sorts of
companies you're hearing from just big
companies just small companies you know
allc comers what's that like so we went
through the numbers the other day and
out of all the companies booked through
August of next year uh about 60% of them
are small they're about under 200
employees and about the other 40% are
you know medium to large siiz companies
depending on you know what that metric
is you know we were looking at like SBA
numbers and 1500 employees is considered
small I think that's pretty large yeah
but man I'm I'm telling you guys you
know everybody listening I'm telling you
that this is exactly what we've seen
over the years we run conferences we go
to conferences we go to events we go to
trade shows we go to all these things
and we constantly I'm telling you from
my personal experience we would have
people ask us questions during the Q&A
sessions whatever it happens to be and
people would openly almost always openly
be like we don't think it's going to
happen we don't think it's real we don't
think it's going to happen and those
same people would call us or come up to
us afterwards and they'd be like when
can we get in line they were you know
it's it's I mean I'm not GNA I'm not g
I'm not hating on the strategy but it
was a lot of in public they were like
casting doubt and then in private being
like we want to be the first one out of
the gate the certification because we
know our competitors aren't going to do
it so you till August so you know we're
expecting the 48 CFR rule at at the
latest based off our math to come out in
like June and according to some of the
government's statements they expect it
to come out as early as March uh you
know I don't have our estimate at August
based off of Ru making average timeline
uh or even close so we would already be
into the beginning of the phase roll out
by the time your availability is open so
if you guys are listening to the show or
watching this clip or you're finding
this somewhere uh definitely give
Fernando a call so I guess a bonus
question I have here before we wrap up
Fernando another another piece of
information uh that's been floating
around or misinformation in my opinion
do your assessments cost
$100,000 no no
nowhere yeah we're we're nowhere near
that uh I mean because you've heard I'm
sure you've heard this right there was
someone got a quote like four years ago
from a company to do their CMC
assessment there's no details about
scope there's no details about size
there's no details about anything and
they allegedly have a quote that says
that their assessment's going to cost
them
$100,000 and this piece of information
crops up everywhere I mean I see it on
social media I see people I see people
cite It In Articles it's in public
comments I have seen no basis for the
average cmmc assessment to cost
$100,000 you're booked out until August
how many of those assessments do you
expect to crack a hundred grand um none
so
[Laughter]
far so I mean so for the for the for
people listening to this right the
average size sort of dib contractor dib
subcontractor you know at 250 employees
or less
you know do they have to worry about
this
$100,000 number I mean is that the
starting point or are you able to be
like that's not that's not that is not
the starting point at all for us okay
all right well it obviously is
situational it obviously depends on
scoping and you know uh company size and
some other factors but uh 100K is not
the upper limit or even the starting
point here no from the mouth of the C3
Pao that we know best uh of them all
it's not $100,000 everybody please
please tell not tell the people writing
the Articles or submitting the public
comments that that's not really a thing
all right so I think that was seven or
eight questions it gets the ball rolling
on some high level topics I'm sure we're
going to have a lot of uh questions in
the comments questions in the chat that
we can maybe come back to in a in a
future uh episode and dive into maybe
some more details of the the successes
and uh obstacles that you've seen to
success in your assessments anything
that you want to leave people with here
at the end of the year headed into the
phase rollout yeah um even if you're not
ready uh I would call AC3 Pao and start
making those reservation agreements and
start getting in line because we're
booked out through August that's eight
months you know from now the average
time that we're seeing 8 to 12 months to
get ready so depending on when you have
to get ready get assessed you might want
to take all you have those conversations
in tandem um another thing too is if
you're working with a C3PO and you're
working with a consultant make sure that
those two are talking to each other and
making sure that they're on the same
page because the time to go through and
start finding out discrepancies or
having a difference of opinion is not
during the time of the assessment gotcha
gotcha that's great advice great advice
well Fernando I know you're obviously
busy you're busy until August so thanks
for the time and uh we'll schedule this
again in the new year uh as we get
closer to 48 C and the phased roll out
and we'll go from there thanks so much
yes sir thank you for having thanks
Fernando thanks Jason
