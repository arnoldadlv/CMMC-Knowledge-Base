## Start Here

This is an AI-consumable CMMC expert knowledge base built from 27 source files (10 Discord community research articles + 17 Summit 7 YouTube transcript analyses). The knowledge is organized into Topics (core knowledge), Decision Frameworks (actionable guides), and Reference materials (supporting data). Use this MOC to navigate the entire knowledge base efficiently.
