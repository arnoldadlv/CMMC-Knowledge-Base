## Export Control

> "CMMC is really providing that cybersecurity hygiene that allows for not just the protection of CUI in a sufficient way but also the protection of export control information in a sufficient way -- even if it wasn't developed under a US government contract. If you're maintaining good cybersecurity hygiene to comply with CMMC, a byproduct of that is you're going to -- as long as you know where your export control information is -- you can apply those same principles to your export control data."
> -- **Stephen Casaza**, President of DTS, on CMMC as a foundation for export control compliance, [[The Intersection of CMMC & Export Control]]

## Enclaves and Scoping

> "They came back to me a week ago and said, 'Daniel, we just ran the DoD distribution statement part B through F and we got 570 files back with just that. It feels like maybe more than 20 people probably are having access to those 570 files.'"
> -- **Daniel Acreage**, Summit 7 Sales / CUI Hotline co-host, on a construction company discovering their CUI footprint was far larger than the 20-person enclave they initially planned, [[CMMC Enclaves by Industry]]

> -- **Daniel Acreage**, Summit 7 Sales / CUI Hotline co-host, warning against Contractor Risk Managed Assets -- an assessor can challenge CRMA classification and require full 110-control assessment, [[CMMC Enclaves by Industry]]

> -- **Summit 7 hosts**, paraphrasing the government's perspective on compliance cost subsidies, [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]]

> "I don't like to use fear as a tactic. I'd rather focus on value in general. I think fear diminishes novel ideas in a lot of different ways. It kind of crushes them. And what you find is working to a list instead of working to a solution."
> -- **Jeff Smedley**, Former CIO/FSO, on executive buy-in strategy, [[Getting CMMC Executive Buy-In with Jeff Smedley]]

## DIBCAC and Enforcement

> -- **Summit 7 hosts**, on the scope gap between CMMC and DIBCAC audits, [[DIBCAC Assessment Requirements]]

## Contracts and Compliance (Don Stern, DLA Piper)

> "Document, document, document. Really make sure that you are writing down and accounting for the decisions you make, the representations you make, the assessment scope that you do. That documentation becomes critical if there ever are questions from the government. It really is what we look to -- are those contemporaneous documentations, not some post hoc thing that you can then develop once you talk to a lawyer and you're under investigation."
> -- **Don Stern**, Co-Chair of Government Contracts, DLA Piper (former DOJ trial attorney), [[When CMMC Meets Contracts]]

> "The false claims act standard is a knowing standard. However, that knowingly category includes reckless disregard and deliberate ignorance. So, I buried my head in the sand. I didn't think about what the standard really was. I spent five minutes and went down the 110 and went check check check... Generally, that's where you could maybe there's plausible deniability, right? But at that point that doesn't really work if you're not doing sufficient diligence."
> -- **Don Stern**, DLA Piper, on the FCA "knowingly" standard, [[When CMMC Meets Contracts]]

> -- **Summit 7 host (Jason)**, on how internal procurement overhead consumes PALT time before implementation even begins, [[No CMMC, No Contract - Why You're Already Too Late for NAVAIR]]

## Phase 1 Discretion and Risk

> "You can read this policy for yourself."
> -- **Summit 7 host (Jacob)**, encouraging defense contractors to read 32 CFR 170.3(E) and the January/July 2025 memos rather than relying on secondhand interpretations, [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]]

> "It's like playing roulette. That's really what it comes down to. You got to play business roulette with this."
> -- **Summit 7 host (Daniel)**, on the risk of assuming Level 2 certification will not be required during Phase 1, [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]]

> -- **Summit 7 host (Daniel)**, warning contractors not to misinterpret Phase 1 guidance as a guarantee of self-assessment only, [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]]

> "No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. Our suppliers put hypersensitive capabilities on satellites. We're going to require that they have a Level 2 certification assessment across the board. Period. We're not jacking around with self-assessments. We already tried that and it didn't work."
> -- **Anonymous requiring activity**, as relayed by Summit 7, on plans to require Level 2 certification during Phase 1, [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]]

> -- **Anonymous higher education research facility president**, as relayed by Daniel (Summit 7), on the urgency of CMMC compliance, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

> "The not so nice term in the MSP industry for a lot of other MSPs are trunk slammers -- they're just trying to pad their portfolio with as many clients as possible. They're not in general specialists in this specific type of regulated work."
> -- **Daniel**, Summit 7 (Sales/Enterprise Accounts), on unqualified MSPs entering the CMMC space, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

> "All the DoD has to do is ask Microsoft how many GCC High tenants even exist. And if the number is a tiny fraction of the amount of companies out there handling export controlled CUI that have DFARS 7012 obligations, then the DoD instantly knows not everybody is ready."
> -- **Jacob**, Summit 7, on GCC High tenant count as a litmus test for DIB readiness, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

> "November of 2026 is the end of CMMC Phase 1 and the start of CMMC Phase 2... it is not a deadline. November 10th of 2026 doesn't mean everyone who would need a Level 2 certification must have it by that date."
> -- **Jacob**, Summit 7, clarifying the phased rollout timeline, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

> "If you fire your MSP, you need to reassess your CMMC score. You could go from an 88, which is minimum, to a negative something... switching partners would likely trigger a re-certification and you're out 40, 50, 60, $70,000."
> -- **Daniel**, Summit 7, on the cost of switching MSPs after certification, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

> "CMMC is required by the FY20 NDAA... the CMMC program is codified at 32 CFR. FAR and DFARS is at 48 CFR. It couldn't remove it even if they wanted to because they can't change a different title of the Code of Federal Regulations."
> -- **Jacob**, Summit 7, on why the FAR overhaul cannot kill CMMC, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

> "If you don't have at least that score, you don't have status. It isn't a question of like we have a bad score. You don't have anything at all. You would fail your self-assessment, which wasn't possible under DFARS 7020."
> -- **Jacob**, Summit 7, on the CMMC minimum SPRS score of 88 for conditional status, [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]]

## Government Perspective

> "The Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative will utilize the False Claims Act to pursue cybersecurity-related fraud by government contractors and grant recipients."
> -- **Department of Justice**, Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative announcement, October 2021, [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]]

> "Just because you're good now doesn't mean that you were good then, and there's proof that you knew you weren't good then, and you got paid. So now it's time to pay up."
> -- **Summit 7 hosts**, summarizing the DOJ's enforcement posture, [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]]
