## How to Use This Glossary

Terms are organized alphabetically. Each entry includes the full name, definition, and links to relevant topic pages where the concept is discussed in depth.

## A

**Affirming Official** -- A designated individual at an organization who certifies assessment results in SPRS and makes the CMMC certification official. The Affirming Official should be at CISO level or below CISO, or president level for smaller companies, providing one layer of objectivity over the assessment team. See [[SPRS and Annual Affirmation]].

**Annual Affirmation** -- The requirement to conduct self-assessment and submit affirmation in SPRS confirming continued compliance in years 2 and 3 of a CMMC certification. Forgetting annual affirmation causes certification to lapse. See [[SPRS and Annual Affirmation]].

**AUKUS** -- Alliance between Australia, United Kingdom, and United States that extends ITAR walls around all three countries rather than removing them, enabling freer trade within the bloc but adding complexity for transactions crossing the expanded boundary. See [[Export Control and CUI Distinctions]].

## B

## C

**C3PAO** -- Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization. Organizations authorized to conduct CMMC Level 2 assessments. A strict firewall exists between advisory/consulting services and assessment services. As of end of 2025, approximately 100 C3PAOs were authorized with ~400 lead assessors. See [[C3PAO Ecosystem and Capacity]].

**CAGE Code** -- Commercial and Government Entity Code. A unique identifier assigned to suppliers to do business with the federal government. The CAGE code hierarchy in SAM.gov must be correct before SPRS will associate assessments with an organization. See [[SPRS and Annual Affirmation]].

**CAP** -- CMMC Assessment Process. The system where assessment records are maintained, including when companies are stopped at Phase 1 due to inadequate documentation. See [[SSP Development]].

**CFR** -- Code of Federal Regulations. CMMC is codified at 32 CFR Part 170, while FAR and DFARS are at 48 CFR. The FAR overhaul cannot change CMMC because it is in a different title of the CFR. See [[DFARS Clauses and Legal Requirements]].

**CIRCIA** -- Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. DHS rule that duplicates DFARS 7012 incident reporting obligations for defense contractors. Originated after the 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack. See [[DFARS Clauses and Legal Requirements]].
