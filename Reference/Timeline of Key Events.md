## Overview

Chronological milestones in CMMC development, from initial DFARS requirements through current implementation phases.

## Pre-CMMC Era (2016-2019)

- **2016:** [[DFARS Clauses and Legal Requirements|DFARS 252.204-7012]] revised and updated to require implementation of NIST SP 800-171. DFARS 252.204-7008 provision added to solicitations to make contractors aware of cybersecurity obligations. FedRAMP Moderate (or equivalent) required for cloud hosting of DoD data. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **December 31, 2017:** Original deadline for full NIST 800-171 implementation under DFARS 7012. *(Source: [[Getting CMMC Executive Buy-In with Jeff Smedley]])*
- **2018:** Beginning of the violations period cited in the 2025 FCA settlement against a small defense contractor. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*

## CMMC 1.0 (2020-2021)

- **2020:** DoD publishes DFARS rule creating CMMC 1.0 (five-level model). Same rule also creates DFARS 252.204-7019 (self-assessment scoring to SPRS) and DFARS 252.204-7020 (DIBCAC audit authority). *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **January 2021:** In the FCA case, the contractor hires a head of security and submits a SPRS score of 104. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **March 2021:** DoD pauses CMMC 1.0 for strategic review. DFARS 7019/7020 remain in effect. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **October 2021:** DOJ announces the **Cyber Civil Fraud Initiative** -- separate from DoD CMMC efforts. Uses the False Claims Act to pursue cybersecurity-related fraud by government contractors. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **November 2021:** DoD announces CMMC 2.0 with three-level model and plans for rulemaking. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*

## CMMC 2.0 Transition (2021-2023)

- **Summer 2022:** Third-party consultant tells the FCA case company their actual SPRS score is negative 142 (not 104). Company does not update their SPRS score. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **January 2023:** FCA case -- head of security leaves company, files whistleblower complaint. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **March 2023:** FCA case -- DOJ serves subpoena less than 60 days after whistleblower complaint. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **June 2023:** FCA case company updates SPRS score to 57; updates to 82 in October 2023. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **2023:** Verizon pays $4.1M FCA settlement with GSA -- a comparison point for the later small contractor settlement. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*

## CMMC 2.0 Final Rule (2024)

- **Spring 2024:** FCA case company achieves perfect SPRS score of 110. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **February 2024:** Jeff Smedley's company (CMMC early adopter, #7 certified) sold for **$1 billion** with acquiring company citing CMMC readiness as valuation factor. *(Source: [[Getting CMMC Executive Buy-In with Jeff Smedley]])*
- **November 2024:** CMMC 2.0 final rule published (32 CFR Part 170). *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
- **December 2024:** CMMC program officially goes into effect (60 days after rule publication). Companies can voluntarily pursue Level 2 assessments. DoD cannot yet require CMMC in contracts. This restarts C3PAO authorizations, assessor Delta training, and assessment process guide updates from zero. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*

## Phase 1 Implementation (2025)

- **January 2025:** DoD memo issued -- "Implementing the CMMC Program: Guidance for Determining Appropriate CMMC Assessment Levels and the Process for Waiving CMMC Assessment Requirements." Sent to senior Pentagon leadership, defense agencies, and all DoD field activity directors. Attachment 1 identifies five CUI categories (CTI, DCISI, NNPI, PSI, UCNID) that trigger Level 2 certification as the minimum requirement. Does not prohibit Level 2 certification during Phase 1. *(Source: [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]], Summit 7, September 2025)*
- **July 2025:** Second DoD guidance memo issued -- "Resources for Implementing the CMMC Program." Restates same guidance: follow 32 CFR 170.3(E) for phased timeline. Includes call-out that "in some procurements DoD may implement CMMC requirements in advance of the planned phase." *(Source: [[Defense Contractors are Betting Their Companies on THIS Assumption About CMMC Phase 1]], Summit 7, September 2025)*
- **September 10, 2025:** **48 CFR CMMC final rule published** in the Federal Register. *(Source: [[CMMC Requirements Are Starting To Show Up]], Summit 7, October 2025)*
- **March 2025:** FCA case settles -- 150-person contractor pays **$4.6 million** for violations from 2018-2023. Whistleblower receives $851,000. ~100 similar cases pending. *(Source: [[DOJ vs Small Defense Contractors]])*
- **May 2025:** Approximately 160 Level 2 certifications achieved (voluntary). *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
- **October 2025:** Over **450 Level 2 certifications** achieved (280% increase since May). ~100 C3PAOs authorized, ~1,400 certified practitioners, ~700 assessors, ~400 lead assessors. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
- **November 10, 2025:** **Phase 1 officially begins.** 48 CFR CMMC final rule effective date. CMMC contract clause language becomes effective. CMMC status is now a condition of contract award. Government shutdown causes a brief staggered start. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]], [[CMMC Requirements Are Starting To Show Up]])*
- **Since October 2025:** At least **half a dozen DIBCAC audit notices** sent to defense contractors informing them of in-person audits of DFARS 7012 compliance. Companies that assumed they only needed CMMC Level 1 are now facing full NIST 800-171 audits with 90-day timelines spanning the holiday season. *(Source: [[DIBCAC Assessment Requirements]], Summit 7, November 2025)*
- **End of 2025 (projected):** ~700 Level 2 certifications, ~100 C3PAOs. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*

## FAR Overhaul and DFARS Changes (2025-2026)

- **August 2025:** Office of Federal Procurement Policy launches the **Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO)** -- the first major overhaul and largest single update to the FAR in its 40-year history. Based on EO 14275 ("Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement"), EO 14265, and OMB Memo M-25-26. Goal: eliminate up to one-third of the FAR. *(Source: [[The End of SPRS Scores (sort of)]])*
- **October 2024:** Microsoft pulls FedRAMP authorization from M365 Commercial, causing widespread non-compliance for defense contractors using that environment. Many remain unaware. *(Source: [[When CMMC Meets Contracts]])*
- **December 2025:** Draft DFARS deviations for the FAR overhaul begin appearing. *(Source: [[The End of SPRS Scores (sort of)]])*
- **January 2026:** Microsoft drops the **GCCI license** for Business Premium in GCC High -- 30-40% cheaper than traditional GCC High licensing, 300 user limit, enables CMMC Level 2 compliance for small businesses. *(Source: [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]], Summit 7, February 2026)*
- **February 1, 2026:** **38 DFARS class deviations go into effect**, including: FAR 52.204-21 renumbered to 52.240-93, DFARS 7019 deleted entirely, DFARS 7020 renumbered to 7997 (basic self-assessment requirement removed). DFARS 7012, 7021, and 7025 unchanged. *(Source: [[The End of SPRS Scores (sort of)]])*
- **TBD (estimated 2027-2028):** Full FAR overhaul rulemaking expected as a gigantic omnibus, incorporating all class deviations into Title 48 of the CFR. FAR CUI rule expected to be included in this omnibus. *(Source: [[The End of SPRS Scores (sort of)]])*

## Current and Upcoming

- **December 2025:** NAVAIR publishes Long Range Acquisition Forecast (LRAF) listing 1,676 contract opportunities ($700K to multi-billion), with 1,070 having calculable PALT timelines. Average solicitation-to-award window: 3.34 quarters (~10 months). *(Source: [[No CMMC, No Contract - Why You're Already Too Late for NAVAIR]], Summit 7, February 2026)*
- **March 19, 2026:** **CIRCIA DIB Town Hall** at 12:00 Eastern -- DHS conducting town halls for the revived Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act proposed rule. The 450-page proposed rule duplicates DFARS 7012 incident reporting obligations with zero DoD/DHS coordination. Defense contractors are the most affected covered entities. *(Source: [[The CUI Hotline - Weekly CMMC Q&A Livestream!]], Summit 7, February 2026)*
- **Q1 2026 (projected):** 1,000-1,500 Level 2 certifications expected. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
- **Q2 2026:** Anticipated surge in NAVAIR activity -- **30% of NAVAIR solicitations** and **32% of contract awards** concentrated in this quarter. *(Source: [[No CMMC, No Contract - Why You're Already Too Late for NAVAIR]], Summit 7, February 2026)*
- **November 2026:** Phase 1 ends; **Phase 2 begins**. Level 3 requirements at department discretion. Predicted ~200 C3PAOs authorized. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
- **November 2027:** Phase 2 ends; Phase 3 begins. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
- **Note:** Summit 7 predicts Level 3 requirements may appear before Phase 2, driven by Golden Dome memo and political climate. DIBCAC is already running Level 3 pilots and accepting scheduling requests. *(Source: [[CMMC Phase 1 - What Comes Next]])*
