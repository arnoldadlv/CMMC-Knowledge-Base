# 3.10.6 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Enforce safeguarding measures for CUI at alternate work sites.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.10.6[a]: Safeguarding measures for CUI are defined for alternate work sites.
- 3.10.6[b]: Safeguarding measures for CUI are enforced for alternate work sites.

---

## Sufficient

- **Controlled environment per 32 CFR 2002.4(f):** "Any area or space an authorized holder deems to have adequate physical or procedural controls (e.g., barriers or managed access controls) to protect CUI from unauthorized access or disclosure" (rybo)
- **Policy and training** fills gaps for defining safeguarding measures - "Are defined" is an ODP (Organization-Defined Parameter), and meeting the intent of the control is key (cosmophagia)
- **Remote work policy** that wraps together the requirements - although not explicitly required, a remote work policy of some kind is needed (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **VPN or similar encrypted tunnel + mandatory training** is a realistic approach for remote worksite (TapirsAndTurtles, Spock67)
- **Home offices and hotel rooms** - walls and locked doors are acceptable physical boundaries (MonkSecurity, cosmophagia)
- **"Reasonable" protections** against unauthorized access in safe/secure area (Topher)
- **Most 800-171 requirements can be inherited** from corporate control implementations by someone working from home (rybo)

---

## Insufficient

- **Printing CUI on unprotected client printers** (reception area) or at home - misinterpretation of ISOO CUI Memo 2020-03-30/DCSA infographic "Print CUI, PII, or PHI only when necessary" does NOT mean printing on any printer is acceptable. Must still comply with 3.10.6, 3.10.1, and 3.8.3 (Tony Buenger)
- **Starbucks/public scenario** with just screen pointed at wall and device in physical possession - doubt this meets the spirit of the controls; walls and locked doors provide better physical boundaries (cosmophagia, MonkSecurity)

---

## Over-engineering

- **Worrying about "spies in a coffee shop"** or **drones viewing CUI on laptop screens in backyards** - this is controlled unclassified, not top secret. "If your requirements are incredibly rigid and require complete lock down, you are talking about classified material, not CUI" (Topher quoting a CCA)
- **Requiring all 110 NIST 800-171 controls apply to alternate work sites** - "If all of 800-171 applied to alternative workspaces, it wouldn't be its own control, it would remain unsaid" (cosmophagia)
- **Ending remote work entirely** - "We cannot lose site of the fact that this is moderate security, for inherently unclassified information" (Spock67)
- **Complex geolocation** to enforce policy for Starbucks/airplane scenarios - policy enforcement is preferable to technical complexity (MonkSecurity)
- **Foreign travel controls as 800-171 requirement** - "Is there an assessment objective that asks about foreign travel controls? There is not, so not a 171 issue" - this is an export compliance issue, not 800-171 (Spock67)

## Edge Cases

### Home Office Scoping Questions (cosmophagia)
- Does the home office need a separate ISP?
- Does it need a firewall appliance?
- Is the home router in scope?
- Scoping grows quickly when you start asking these questions

### VDI for Scoping (cosmophagia)
- VDI used extensively to scope endpoints as CRMAs (Contractor Risk Managed Assets)
- BUT this doesn't resolve questions about connecting to VDI while traveling or in public

### Travelers, Conferences, Public Spaces
- The rest of the physical access controls are a pain point for travelers, conferences, and home offices (cosmophagia)
- Some companies take strict interpretation: prohibit Starbucks scenario, only allow laptop to open from home offices and HQ (cosmophagia)

### ODP Ownership (Organization-Defined Parameters)
- As of 32 CFR final rule, the "O" in ODP is the DoD, not the contractor (Art_Vandelay)

### Work Environment Categories
- Reference Peak Infosec video/article that identifies 4 work environments with different considerations

## Evidence Examples

- **Remote work policy** defining approved alternate work sites and safeguarding requirements
- **User training/acknowledgment** covering telework CUI handling requirements
- **VPN configuration** demonstrating encrypted tunnel for remote access
- **Hard drive encryption** for data at rest on remote devices
- **Client-side encryption** for data in transit
- **DCSA CUI Telework Do's and Don'ts infographic** (referenced but should be applied correctly, not used to justify uncontrolled printing)

## Key Quotes

> "You need to create a controlled environment. From 32 CFR 2002.4(f): Controlled environment is any area or space an authorized holder deems to have adequate physical or procedural controls (e.g., barriers or managed access controls) to protect CUI from unauthorized access or disclosure." - rybo (Moderator, Fellow)

> "Safeguarding measures for CUI is a loaded term. Some I've talked to interpret this to mean 'All of NIST 800-171'. Others have said 'that's crazy, even the government doesn't do that', and 'this was written before COVID made everyone start working from home'." - cosmophagia (Certified CMMC Professional)

> "Policy and training fills some of these gaps. 'Are defined' is an ODP and as long as you meet the intent of the control, you're good. And finally, if all of 800-171 applied to alternative workspaces, it wouldn't be its own control, it would remain unsaid." - cosmophagia

> "I really think, although not explicitly required, that you need a remote work policy of some kind to wrap this together. Also cop out may be unfair. Bring the hammer. End remote work. Put every person on a computer in a windowless basement chained to a desk so they dont carry that 'unclassified' information out in their unencrypted head. We cannot lose site of the fact that this is moderate security, for inherently unclassified information." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "If your requirements are incredibly rigid and require complete lock down, you are talking about classified material, not CUI" - CCA quoted by Topher

> "Is there an assessment objective that asks about foreign travel controls? There is not, so not a 171 issue." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "I actually agree with the Starbucks/airplane kind of scenario [being prohibited]. But, by policy more than trying to do some complicated geolocation. I am good with homes and hotel rooms." - MonkSecurity (CCP)

> "Walls and locked doors are great physical boundaries. While I appreciate the argument that pointing your screen toward a wall and having it in your direct physical possession is sufficient for the Starbucks scenario, I have a feeling that isn't the spirit of these controls." - cosmophagia
