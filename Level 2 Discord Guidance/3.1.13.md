# 3.1.13 - Expertise Overlay
## Cryptographic Mechanisms for Remote Access Sessions

**Control Text:** Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.13[a] cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions are identified.
- 3.1.13[b] cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions are implemented.

## Sufficient

### Encryption Requirements - FIPS vs Non-FIPS Distinction
- **All remote connections need encryption** per this control
- **FIPS validation is ONLY required if the connection is transmitting CUI** (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- If CUI is not accessed or transmitted during a remote session, standard encrypted connections (non-FIPS) are acceptable

### Layered Encryption Approach
- VPN encryption can run on top of TLS encryption - **as long as ONE layer is FIPS validated, you are good** (Spock67, CCA)
- Example: A TLS 1.2 FIPS connection from a laptop to a server riding across a VPN that is also encrypted - if one is FIPS, compliant
- Windows 11 Pro laptop configured in FIPS mode connecting to Windows Server (also in FIPS mode) over non-FIPS VPN = **sufficient** because the endpoint-to-endpoint TLS is FIPS validated

### GCC-High / Cloud CUI Environments
- If the only relevant CUI data flows are via GCC-High (Outlook, SharePoint, etc.), **VPN has no FIPS requirements** (Uncouth, CCP)
- Reason: Microsoft GCC-High already handles the FIPS-validated encryption for CUI in transit
- **Computer must still be running in FIPS mode** for Bitlocker data-at-rest compliance

### Remote Administration Without CUI Access
- Remote administration of CUI assets (e.g., OS updates, configuration management) via SSH with MFA **does not require FIPS** if:
  - No CUI is accessed during the session
  - No CUI is transmitted (exchanged) during the session
  - Proper audit logs document that no unauthorized CUI access occurred
- This scenario was validated as likely to pass assessment (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)

---

## Insufficient

### Policy-Only Approach
- Having a policy stating users cannot access CUI remotely **does NOT eliminate the 3.1.13 requirement**
- "Does it apply even with the policy controls? I think absolutely yes." (Spock67, CCA)

### RDP Without Proper Configuration
- Standard RDP connection from BYOD device to in-scope system **makes the BYOD device in-scope** if it cannot prevent CUI processing/storage/transmission
- RDP does NOT inherently limit data to Keyboard/Video/Mouse only

### Non-FedRAMP Cloud Services for CUI
- zScaler Commercial (non-FedRAMP) **cannot be used** for CUI remote access
- If ZTE (Zscaler Tunnel Edge) breaks FIPS validation chain (even temporarily for routing), it may violate 3.1.13, 3.13.11, and 3.13.8
- **Must use FedRAMP Moderate authorized version** (zScaler Gov) for CUI workflows

### Missing FIPS Mode on Endpoints
- If computer is not running in FIPS mode, Bitlocker encryption for data-at-rest is **insufficient** (Uncouth, CCP)
- FIPS Mode must be enabled on the computer via Intune or GPO

---

## Over-engineering

### Requiring FIPS for ALL Remote Administration
- Some organizations require FIPS for any remote administration, even when no CUI is involved
- This is **not required** by 3.1.13 - the control is about protecting **confidentiality of remote access sessions** involving CUI
- SSH or encrypted remote admin to a CUI asset for maintenance purposes (no CUI access/transmission) does not require FIPS

### FIPS VPN When Using GCC-High Exclusively
- If all CUI flows through GCC-High services, requiring a FIPS VPN is **over-engineering**
- GCC-High provides the FIPS-validated encryption already

---

## Edge Cases

### VDI Client Scoping
- Per 32 CFR: "An endpoint hosting a VDI client configured to not allow any processing, storage, or transmission of CUI beyond the Keyboard/Video/Mouse sent to the VDI client is considered an Out-of-Scope Asset"
- The endpoint connecting TO an in-scope VDI server hosting CUI can be out of scope IF properly configured
- **FIPS is only relevant on the in-scope asset's side** - the out-of-scope desktop and its WiFi are also out of scope

### RDP/VDI Configuration for BYOD
- RDP CAN be configured via GPO to disable:
  - Clipboard redirection (even directional - allow copy IN but restrict OUT)
  - Drive redirection
  - LPT port (printing)
- These settings must be applied on the **Remote Desktop Session Host** (the device serving RDP), NOT the client
- If properly configured, the BYOD client could potentially be out of scope

### Outbound Remote Access from CUI Network
- Outbound remote sessions (e.g., Zoho Assist to client sites for non-CUI work) **still need encryption**
- **FIPS validation only required if CUI is transmitted**
- May be considered under 3.1.20 (external connections) rather than 3.1.13

### wolfssh for FIPS Port Forwarding
- Using wolfssh with FIPS 140-2 cryptography to tunnel RDP (port forwarding) was raised but **not enough context was provided** to determine sufficiency
- Technical dependencies make it difficult to provide blanket answers

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence Patterns (Based on Discussion)
1. **VPN/TLS Configuration Screenshots** showing FIPS-validated ciphers enabled
2. **Windows FIPS Mode Registry/GPO Settings** showing FIPS algorithm policy enabled
3. **Remote Desktop Session Host GPO** showing disabled redirections (clipboard, drives, LPT)
4. **GCC-High Architecture Documentation** showing CUI flows through FedRAMP-authorized services
5. **SSH Configuration Files** showing cryptographic algorithms used
6. **Audit Logs** demonstrating no CUI access during administrative remote sessions
7. **FedRAMP Authorization Documentation** for cloud services handling CUI

### Evidence Considerations
- Azure Virtual Desktop server-side settings can enforce restrictions on local clients
- Microsoft provides GPO settings for Remote Desktop Services: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-remotedesktopservices

## Relationship to Other Controls

- **3.13.11** (Cryptographic Protection of CUI) - Must be read in conjunction with 3.1.13; FIPS requirements come from 3.13.11 when CUI is transmitted
- **3.1.20** (External Connections) - May apply to outbound remote sessions to external networks
- **3.13.8** (Data-at-Rest Encryption) - FIPS mode on endpoints affects Bitlocker compliance
