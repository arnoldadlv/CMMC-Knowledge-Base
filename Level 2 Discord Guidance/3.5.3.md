# 3.5.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.5.3[a] privileged accounts are identified
- 3.5.3[b] multifactor authentication is implemented for local access to privileged accounts
- 3.5.3[c] multifactor authentication is implemented for network access to privileged accounts
- 3.5.3[d] multifactor authentication is implemented for network access to non-privileged accounts

**DIBCAC Finding:** This is the second most failed control in DIBCAC audits.

## Sufficient

### Accepted MFA Implementations
- **Cisco Duo at OS level** - Widely recommended; does not require FedRAMP for security protection components
- **FIDO2/YubiKey hardware tokens** - Hardware security keys with biometric options
- **Microsoft Authenticator app push notifications** - Acceptable for network access
- **TOTP authenticator apps** (Google/Microsoft Authenticator) - Meets replay-resistant MFA requirements per 800-63-4
- **Windows Hello for Business with biometrics** - More readily accepted than PIN-only
- **TPM + PIN** - Passed joint surveillance assessment per one user: "TPM+PIN=MFA"
- **MFA to PAM/secrets vault to retrieve privileged passwords** - "With MFA required to get the passwords that don't require MFA... you have implemented MFA"
- **LAPS passwords stored in Intune with MFA required to access Intune** - Acceptable for objective [b]
- **Certificate-based VPN authentication** - Computer certificate (something you have) + password (something you know), especially if certificate deployment requires MFA
- **SSO/SAML from MFA-authenticated session** - Acceptable when properly configured

### Session/Token Considerations
- **Sign-in frequency policies** (e.g., 7 days) combined with other controls passed DIBCAC
- **Conditional Access policies requiring MFA** - "CA policies aren't MFA themselves, they just force the use of whichever MFA tool is currently configured"
- **Primary Refresh Token (PRT) with MFA claims** - Debated but some assessors accept "properly configured" PRT

---

## Insufficient

### Rejected Implementations
- **MFA only at initial device enrollment/setup** - "No way only requiring MFA one time would pass"
- **MFA only for M365/VPN but not internal network access** - Common misunderstanding; network access means ALL network access
- **Domain-joined device alone as a factor** - Domain joining does not link device to specific user
- **Compliant device + IP whitelisting alone** - "Compliant device and IP whitelisting is not MFA"
- **MAC address whitelisting as MFA factor** - Too easily spoofed; "I would not recommend MAC whitelisting as a form of MFA"
- **Location/geolocation as a factor** - "Per DoD, where you are cannot be considered a factor"
- **Intune/Microsoft Endpoint Manager as MFA** - "Microsoft Endpoint Manager is an Access Control mechanism. You cannot use it for MFA"
- **Password bypass option available** - "Does it count as MFA if you can simply pick 'other options' and log on with password and no TPM check instead?"
- **Shared email accounts for OTP delivery** - Untraceable to individuals; problematic for password resets
- **Email verification links** - Debated; may not meet replay-resistant requirements

### Common Misunderstandings Corrected
- **"Network access" means only remote/internet access** - WRONG. Network access includes LAN access. "Don't confuse LAN with local access. Local access = without use of a network"
- **"Local access" means on the LAN** - WRONG. Local access means no network at all (air-gapped)
- **"Non-privileged users don't need MFA for device login"** - Only true for standalone (air-gapped) computers per NIST 162
- **"MFA at workstation covers all subsequent access"** - NOT necessarily. "3.5.3 requires MFA to be used when accessing an account, not a session"

---

## Over-engineering

### Potentially Excessive Approaches
- **MFA on every lock/unlock throughout the day** - Debated heavily; "If you need MFA every login that's wild"
- **MFA for WiFi connection** - "WiFi doesn't give them access to data. It gives them access to the information system that has the data and that requires MFA"
- **MFA on printers** - Edge case; can be managed via network segmentation instead: "You could put it on its own subnet/vlan and leave management ports like 443 closed/blocked inbound"
- **MFA on file sharing applications when accessed from already-MFA'd device** - "By the exact wording, it's not required to MFA into every service, especially coming from a CUI asset"
- **DIBCAC required MFA on firewalls** - One user noted: "DIBCAC made us add MFA to our firewalls, I feel that's overreach but it was easy so we did it"

---

## Edge Cases

### Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) - Heavily Debated
- **Technical argument FOR:** NIST 800-63B defines TPM as "multi-factor crypto hardware" meeting AAL2/3
- **Technical argument AGAINST:** "The second factor of laptop TPM is the thing you're trying to protect using MFA"
- **Assessor perspective (rybo):** "I would accept WHfB with TPM/PIN as an assessor because of its alignment with 800-63B, but I'm not going to recommend it to my clients. There's a high likelihood an assessor will ask the OSC to demonstrate their MFA process, and won't 'see' the multiple factors in use."
- **Key issue:** Many organizations configure WHfB enrollment but don't ENFORCE it, allowing password bypass
- **Biometrics vs PIN:** WHfB with biometrics more defensible than PIN-only: "Why would that same assessor see two factors in WHfB using biometrics but only one factor in WHfB using pin?"

### Mobile Devices
- **DoD Toolbox exemption:** "MFA is not required to access a mobile device (e.g., smart phones) even if they contain covered defense information... typically mobile devices do not support MFA in order to access the device"
- **BUT:** "They do highlight you should MFA when accessing a network resource from the smart phone"

### Specialized Assets / Manufacturing Floor
- Can treat OT systems as Specialized Assets with MFA as enduring exception
- Must still have compensating controls

### Network Devices (Switches/Routers/Firewalls)
- Admin access to network device CLI/web portal - privileged network access requiring MFA
- TACACS/NPS with MFA, or MFA to PAM to retrieve credentials
- Badge access to restricted area NOT acceptable as MFA factor per DoD

### Thin Clients/RDP Terminals
- If workstation only provides KVM access to VDI (no data passing back and forth), can be de-scoped
- If CUI passes through the session, MFA required at RDP server access

### SSO After Initial MFA
- Switching accounts requires new MFA: "If the account has been authenticated with MFA, you're good. It's when you are switching accounts and don't MFA to the second one that I see a problem"

### Privileged Role Elevation
- "I'd say most assessors are used to seeing separate MFA prompts for priv and non-priv accounts"
- If no way to sign into priv account without first signing into non-priv account with MFA, may be acceptable

### UAC Prompts
- Windows Hello does not prompt at UAC - known gap
- Solutions: Duo MFA at OS level, or never use privileged accounts locally

---

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence Types
- Screenshots of Conditional Access policies showing MFA enforcement
- Duo/MFA solution configuration showing local device integration
- Azure AD authentication logs showing MFA events
- Demonstration of MFA prompt during assessment
- WHfB configuration showing biometric or FIDO requirement
- LAPS/PAM configuration with MFA-protected access

### Evidence Pitfalls
- **If using "remember device" for 7+ days:** Have testing method ready since MFA won't trigger during assessment week
- **If using WHfB:** Be prepared to explain technically how TPM + PIN/biometric = two factors
- **Configuration showing enrollment vs enforcement:** Must show WHfB is enforced, not just enrolled

## Key Quotes

**On DIBCAC failure rate:**
> "This is the second most failed part of DIBCAC audits (according to DIBCAC)." - ace_rimmer (Fellow)

**On common misunderstanding:**
> "I have seen some general misunderstanding of where MFA is required at times. MFA on M365 and VPN's because that is 'remote/network' but then MFA is not implemented for anything else because I'm on the local network or some other similar reason." - itsallsimple (C3PAO, AOS-G)

**On WHfB debate:**
> "Audit risk is real, y'all. I would accept WHfB with TPM/PIN as an assessor because of its alignment with 800-63B, but I'm not going to recommend it to my clients. There's a high likelihood an assessor will ask the OSC to demonstrate their MFA process, and won't 'see' the multiple factors in use." - rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

**On TPM as factor:**
> "NIST 800-63b says a TPM is valid MFA factor of something you have. If assessors are going to argue that WHfB doesn't meet MFA then honestly this is all a shoot from the hip joke of a framework." - Community member

**On the "stolen laptop" argument:**
> "If you steal a laptop, all you need is the PIN. Same as having no MFA for physical access. Have an out of band MFA negates worry if a system is stolen." - Community member

**On Duo recommendation:**
> "Cypher, easiest answer is to use Cisco DUO and just go to best practice and have everyone MFA offline and online from the computer. It is what we do and there are no discussions about it. Also, you do not need to use DUO FedRAMP. As a Security Protection component, FedRAMP is not required." - Community member

**On LAPS with MFA to vault:**
> "With MFA required to get the passwords that don't require MFA... you have implemented MFA." - Community consensus

**On session requirements:**
> "We do not require MFA except when a session times out or initial login. Passed DIBCAC." - Community member with DIBCAC experience

**On network devices:**
> "In my most recent DIBCAC, they had us change the firewall to a separate priv account that used MFA, but did not ask about routers/switches/printers." - Community member

**On FedRAMP for MFA solutions:**
> "FedRAMP isn't required for cloud SPAs but you need to be able to show how that cloud SPA is compliant with 800-171 on the cloud vendor's side and the customer (your) side." - Community guidance
