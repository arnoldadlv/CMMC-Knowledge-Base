## Sufficient

### Log Types Accepted
- **Procedural (written logs):** Paper sign-in sheets with name and date (rybo, citing 800-171)
- **Automated logs:** Badge reader systems, PIV card systems (rybo, citing 800-171)
- **Motion-activated camera footage with timestamps:** "The fact that each video clip is a separate entry with a timestamp feels like a log to me. I'd accept it." (rybo, Moderator/MEP)
- **Alarm arm/disarm event logs** paired with paper visitor logs (rybo)
- **M365 audit trail of logins from Named Location** corresponding to office static IPs (rybo)
- **ERP scan in/out logs** combined with camera footage for corroboration (marieramsay, Moderator)
- **Unifi motion tracking logs:** "In the past we've used the unifi logging on motion tracking to meet some DoD requirements that were approved." (Max)
- **Combination approaches:** Badge system logs + camera footage; alarm logs + paper log

### Time/Date Requirements
- NIST glossary defines "audit log" as "A chronological record" - this implies date and time (Kenneth Ingham, CCA)
- Time in/out is valuable for continuous monitoring and spotting anomalies like after-hours access (rybo)
- However, the 800-171 and Assessment Guide never explicitly require exact timestamps

### Entry-Only Logging
- "Most badge systems don't log when an employee leaves either, I would say that's the same concept" (Lali Pap)
- Entry-only logging is acceptable; sign-out not explicitly required
- "Requiring badge to leave would probably be a safety issue bc of fires and such" (Lali Pap)

### Home Office / Small Facility
- For a home office where one person controls all keys and is the only one present most days: can log "I was here and no one else was present at the facilities" for solo days, with detailed time logs only when others visit (Liatris, LCCA/C3PAO)
- Key requirement: "Just make sure to describe how no one else could access the area without your assistance" (Liatris)

### Cloud-Only Organizations
- If company uses only cloud infrastructure (cloud enclave, VDIs, no on-prem): can inherit PE controls from CSP
- Still need to account for alternate work sites with AUP and clean screen policies (Liatris, LCCA)

## Insufficient

### Time Clock Approach - Gaps Identified
- Time clocks alone problematic when:
  - Employees don't clock out for smoke breaks, bathroom breaks, going to car (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
  - Multiple entrances/exits far from time clocks (Glenda)
  - Salaried employees/managers/owners not required to clock in (Glenda)
- "Do they clock out if they go grab something from the car and clock back in? Clock out/in for smoke breaks? I don't like the idea of doors with no time clock close by if the time clock is your only access log" (Glenda)

### Confused Scope
- Logging computer logins on a laptop is NOT the same as physical access logging - rybo clarified: "Not sure how this question relates to a discussion about physical access logs for facilities and controlled areas"
- Physical access logs are for facilities/controlled areas, not system access

---

## Over-engineering

### AI Facial Recognition Systems
- Motorola Avigilon with AI tracking, facial recognition, clothes pattern matching: "about 6 pinky's out expensive" ($15k for single door/camera) (Max, rybo)
- Not necessary for compliance - simpler solutions work

### NFO Controls (PE-8(1))
- Related control PE-8(1) from SP 800-53 mentions automated mechanisms for visitor record maintenance/review
- "The NFO controls are not in the CMMC Assessment Guides that the assessors will use" (Glenda, Lead CCA)
- "I took a shot for a while at including the NFO's in my tracking and implementation process. After a mock assessment I decided no one really cared and have stopped." (Spock67, CCA)

### Regular Review Requirements
- "There is no requirement to view them regularly. You need to maintain them so they can be reviewed if there is an incident that requires investigation." (Glenda)
- Logs don't need to be searchable beyond "papers in a file folder" level

---

## Edge Cases

### Work From Home / Alternate Work Sites
- WFH is an alternate work site - see 3.10.6 for guidance (Jake)
- For alternate worksites: AUP and clean screen policy may suffice when combined with CSP inheritance (Liatris)

### Home Office as Primary Facility
- A home office with servers/equipment IS a primary facility requiring physical access logs
- Locked room + locked server cabinet is good layered protection
- Can simplify logging if one person controls all keys and is sole access point

### Multiple Entrances Without Badge Readers
- Camera footage at all entrances + ERP job tracking as corroborating evidence can work (marieramsay, crane476)
- "You might want to get a C3PAO perspective or two on that, but from my point of view, that makes a lot of sense" (marieramsay)
- Confirmed acceptable by CCA: "Sounds good to me" (Glenda)

### Ring/Blink Cameras
- External cameras on Ring/Blink acceptable if not pointing at CUI
- "Is Ring storing/processing/or transmitting CUI? As long as the cameras aren't pointing inside where there's CUI, probably not, so it wouldn't *need* to be FedRAMP" (Liatris, LCCA/C3PAO)
- Can use guest wifi network for security cameras (marieramsay)

### Visitor Sign-Out
- Sign-out not explicitly required; can use camera footage for exit timing
- "The control says to maintain access logs, not specification on whether entry and exit both need to be logged" (Lali Pap)

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence
1. Paper visitor logbook (name, date/time in)
2. Badge reader access logs
3. Motion-activated camera footage with timestamps
4. Alarm system arm/disarm logs
5. M365 Named Location login audit trails
6. ERP system job scan logs
7. Unifi camera/badge system logs
8. Ring/Blink camera footage (external, timestamps)
9. Combination: badge system + camera footage

### SMB-Friendly Solutions
- "Cameras are a great solution that I routinely recommend to small biz. As long as they record footage with a timestamp, that's a valid log of access that doesn't require people to do anything." (Glenda)
- "If hardwiring CCTV is out of the question right now, take a step and go with a Ring or Blink...paying for the monthly cloud upload (with a strong secure PW) and putting them on a guest wifi network." (marieramsay)
- "Until someone tells me not to use unifi, I'd give those small smb's unifi badging, cameras, and nvrs." (Max)

## Key Quotes

> "Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof." - 800-171, quoted by rybo

> "Definition of 'audit log' from the NIST glossary: A chronological record of system activities. Includes records of system accesses and operations performed in a given period." - Kenneth Ingham, CCA

> "The most important question you can answer is whether date and time is useful to you, for your internal reviews and processes." - rybo

> "The fact that each video clip is a separate entry with a timestamp feels like a log to me. I'd accept it." - rybo (on motion-activated camera footage)

> "Cameras are a great solution that I routinely recommend to small biz. As long as they record footage with a timestamp, that's a valid log of access that doesn't require people to do anything." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

> "There is no requirement to view them regularly. You need to maintain them so they can be reviewed if there is an incident that requires investigation. They don't have to be any more searchable than papers in a file folder." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

> "Are you ensuring no one else enters, acting like a guard? Stating that might be fine, it's answering the assessor's follow up question: How are you ensuring you were the only one to enter the room when three people have the keys?" - Liatris, LCCA

> "Most badge systems don't log when an employee leaves either, I would say that's the same concept" - Lali Pap (on not requiring sign-out)
