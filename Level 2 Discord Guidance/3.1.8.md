# 3.1.8 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Limit unsuccessful logon attempts.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.8[a] the means of limiting unsuccessful logon attempts is defined.
- 3.1.8[b] the defined means of limiting unsuccessful logon attempts is implemented.

## Sufficient

No discussion found.

## Insufficient

No explicit pass/fail criteria discussed. However, the conversation implies that having a cloud service (AWS GovCloud) without native account lockout capability creates a compliance gap that must be addressed through compensating controls or alternative architecture.

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

### AWS GovCloud Lacks Native Account Lockout
A user raised that AWS GovCloud does not provide a way to enforce account lockout at all. This creates a compliance challenge for organizations using GovCloud as part of their CUI scope.

**Assessor Response (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA):** Asked whether the organization has "the means of limiting access to AWS GovCloud only to your authorized endpoints" - suggesting that restricting which endpoints can access GovCloud could be a compensating approach.

**Assessor Response (Uncouth, CCP):** Asked clarifying scoping questions - "is that your only scope? what other systems do you have? how do you access the AWS Govcloud?" - indicating that the full architecture matters for determining compliance posture.

### Multi-Environment Scope Considerations
The user clarified they have CUI on both GCC-High and endpoints, accessing GovCloud through AWS CLI or browser. This multi-environment scenario suggests:
- Lockout controls on endpoints may partially compensate
- Access method (CLI vs browser) may affect available controls
- GCC-High likely has its own lockout mechanisms that apply to that portion of scope

## Evidence Examples

No specific evidence examples were discussed in this thread. The conversation focused on architectural challenges rather than documentation requirements.

## Summary of Discussion

This thread contains limited but focused discussion on a specific edge case: cloud services (AWS GovCloud) that lack native account lockout functionality. The assessors' responses suggest two possible compliance approaches:

1. **Scoping approach:** Understand the full architecture - if other systems in scope (endpoints, GCC-High) have lockout controls, those may satisfy the requirement for those portions of the environment.

2. **Compensating control approach:** Limiting which endpoints can access the cloud service (endpoint restriction) may serve as an alternative means of limiting unauthorized access attempts.

The thread does not reach a conclusion on whether these approaches would satisfy an assessor - the conversation appears incomplete.
