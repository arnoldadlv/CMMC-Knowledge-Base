# 3.8.7 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Control the use of removable media on system components.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.7[a] the use of removable media on system components is controlled.

---

## Sufficient

- **Hardware-encrypted drives with endpoint control**: Apricorn 3NX drives assigned to users with a business need, combined with endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like CrowdStrike to control the connection of drives. EDR can also audit what files were written to/from each drive. *(Endorsed by rybo - Moderator/Fellow)*

- **Locking bezels on hot-swappable drives**: For server hot-swap drives, a locking bezel in front of the drive bays can serve as the physical control to prevent unauthorized media use.

## Edge Cases

### Hot-Swappable Server Drives
**Question**: Do hot-swappable drives on a server qualify as "removable media"?

**Expert Guidance**: Per DODM 5205.07 (Special Access Programs):
> "Non-removable IS storage media includes any devices processing or storing SAP data that is accessible only via the removal of computer panels or the application of hand tools. Examples include hard drives internal to a central processing unit."

**Interpretation**: By this standard, hot-swappable drives that can be removed without tools WOULD be considered removable media. However, a locking bezel could serve as the control mechanism to address this requirement.

---

## Evidence Examples

- Policy documentation defining authorized removable media types
- EDR/endpoint protection configuration showing device control rules
- Audit logs showing files written to/from removable media devices
- List of approved encrypted drives assigned to users with business need
- Physical controls documentation (e.g., locking bezels on server drive bays)

> "So by that standard, yes they would be considered removable. Which I would tend to agree with UNLESS you have a locking bezel in front of them (or even then, you could say the locking bezel is your control to prevent unauthorized media use)."
