# 3.1.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions and privileged accounts.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.5[a] privileged accounts are identified.
- 3.1.5[b] access to privileged accounts is authorized in accordance with the principle of least privilege.
- 3.1.5[c] security functions are identified.
- 3.1.5[d] access to security functions is authorized in accordance with the principle of least privilege.

## Sufficient

- **Two accounts per user (admin + normal):** A Certified CMMC Assessor (Spock67) confirmed that for a small 3-person company, two accounts (domain admin and normal user) is acceptable. "Define the privileged account as the domain admin accounts."

- **Entra ID PIM for cloud:** Using Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Entra for dedicated admin accounts with least privilege roles is an acceptable approach.

- **Separate admin naming convention:** Having standard accounts (first.last) and dedicated admin accounts (first.last.da) demonstrates account separation.

- **Narrow definition allowed:** An assessor stated "I would allow you to define that narrowly" regarding privileged accounts, but you must identify SOME privileged accounts.

---

## Insufficient

- **Domain Admin accounts used across all systems:** Using DA accounts for tasks that do not explicitly require DA privilege levels is "the principle of most privilege" and an assessor may take issue with this.

- **Claiming no privileged accounts exist:** An assessor (Spock67) explicitly stated: "You must have some privileged accounts to run your IT. I would allow you to define that narrowly, but saying none would probably result in Not Met."

- **Using Domain Admin for local endpoint tasks:** Installing software on local endpoints using domain admin credentials violates least privilege - "if that one piece of software has malware...you're now enabling that software to potentially take down everything."

---

## Over-engineering

- **Three separate account types (DA, local admin, normal) for very small orgs:** Discussion indicated that for a 3-person company, requiring domain admin, local administrator, AND normal user accounts would be excessive. "I think two accounts required. Not three."

*Note: While not required for CMMC, the security best practice is still to use tiered administration (DA only on domain controllers, local admin for endpoints).*

## Edge Cases

### Small Organizations (3 people)
- Two accounts (privileged + normal) per person is acceptable
- Domain admin can serve as the single privileged account type
- Must still identify and document these as privileged accounts

### Outsourced IT
- If IT functions are handled by an outside department, the organization may not directly use privileged accounts
- However, you still need to identify what accounts exist that have elevated privileges (even if managed externally)
- Security functions enforced by external IT still need to be documented

### Government Information Systems (DISS, PCIP, NBIS)
- PKI-authenticated access to government systems does NOT automatically make those accounts "privileged accounts" for your CMMC scope
- The question is whether those accounts are used to "enforce your security policies" on YOUR systems
- Global Admins in your own tenant ARE privileged accounts

### Service Accounts
- Question was raised: "Does this control apply to service accounts as well or just interactive user 'real people' accounts?"
- No definitive answer provided in the discussion.

## Evidence Examples

- **Entra ID PIM configuration** showing dedicated admin accounts with role-based privileges
- **Active Directory account listings** showing separation between standard accounts (first.last) and admin accounts (first.last.da)
- **Documentation defining what constitutes a privileged account** in your environment
- **List of identified privileged accounts** with their authorization/justification

## NIST Definitions Referenced

**Privileged User:** A user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.

**Security Functions:** The hardware, software, or firmware of the system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.
