# 3.4.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives (8 total):**
- [a-d] Physical access restrictions: defined, documented, approved, enforced
- [e-h] Logical access restrictions: defined, documented, approved, enforced

---

## Sufficient

### DIBCAC-Accepted SSP Response (Jake, Fellow)
> "All aspects of changes are handled via our change management process as outlined in control 3.4.3. All systems are in a physically secured building, with servers, security appliances, and networking equipment in limited access rooms."

**Key insight:** DIBCAC accepted this approach when shown the change management process covered all aspects.

### Acceptable Implementation Elements
- Change management process that addresses physical/logical access as part of change workflow
- Physical security: servers/network equipment in limited access rooms with controlled entry (badge readers, locks)
- Logical security: policies, procedures, rules, training with appropriate documentation
- Network placement controls: ensuring new devices go on correct VLAN/DMZ
- Reference to 3.4.3 (change management) for procedural coverage

### Work-From-Home Approach (CCA-endorsed)
For 100% remote organizations:
- Inherit physical security from FedRAMP cloud solutions
- Remote Work Policy or Acceptable Use Policy covering physical security in the home
- Disallow printing (reduces physical CUI complications)
- Policy requiring: one locked door minimum, prevent shoulder surfing, secure laptop when not in use

## Insufficient

No explicit "insufficient" examples were discussed in this channel.

## Over-engineering

### Granular Lock Documentation Example (Richard)
The following was presented as one interpretation but may be over-engineering for most contexts:

- Definition: "This is the physical lock that restricts access to the server room"
- Documentation: "The lock is a xxx brand, model xxx"
- Approval: "use of the lock was approved by xxxx"
- Enforcement: "xxx verified that the lock effectively restricts access to the server room"

**Note:** This level of detail for every physical control (brand/model of every lock) is likely excessive for most assessments.

---

## Edge Cases

### Control Scope - Security-Relevant Changes Only?
**Question raised:** Is 3.4.5 limited to security-relevant changes? Example: user changing desktop theme is technically a "change" to an "organizational system" but seems out of scope.

**Expert guidance (Uncouth, CCP; Spock67, CCA):**
- Consider this alongside 3.4.2 (security-relevant settings)
- Consider least privilege and least functionality definitions
- These controls all tie together
- "You have a lot of power in how you define these things"
- "Use your power of definition here. It says you have to write the fundamental definition of what fits."

**Practical interpretation:** Scope to baseline/security-relevant changes (who can change baseline, who can force deviation from baseline).

### Overlap/Duplicate Control Concerns
**Raised by thwackooey:** 3.4.5 appears duplicative of:
- 3.4.3 (change management)
- 3.1.2, 3.1.5, 3.1.7 (access control requirements)

**Response:** DIBCAC accepted 3.4.5 being addressed through 3.4.3 change management process, suggesting some flexibility in how overlap is handled.

### Physical Access Logging for Key-Only Closets
**Spock67's approach:** For server closets with only key access (no badge reader), uses clipboard with open/close sheet for IT staff to log access. Acknowledges "They use it at least sometimes."

---

## Evidence Examples

### Physical Access Controls
- Badge reader logs for server room access
- Key control logs (clipboard sign-in/sign-out sheets)
- Physical lock documentation
- Limited access room designations

### Logical Access Controls
- Admin rights restrictions (who can make configuration changes)
- Credentials required for modifying configuration settings
- Credentials required for patching software
- Credentials required for updating software libraries

### Change Management Integration
- Change management process/procedure document
- Change request forms showing approval workflow
- Network diagrams showing VLAN assignments
- Asset inventory updates tied to changes
- Baseline configuration verification records

### Remote Work
- Remote Work Policy
- Acceptable Use Policy
- FedRAMP inheritance documentation

## Key Quotes

**Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA:**
> "Make sure new devices go on the right network/VLAN/DMZ."

> "'Things' meaning policies, procedures, rules, training yes with appropriate documentation so people understand how to make changes without breaking something"

> "Your change management process is the policy, it says what has to happen before a change can be made. The procedures for making a change might say something like get approval from X first, then consult network diagram to determine proper jacks to use for a new computer (on the data VLAN not the voice VLAN for example), add that device to the asset inventory, document the IP/user assigned to it, make sure it has the baseline config, and so on."

> "Sadly, many of the Examples in the AG are misleading."

**Jake (Fellow, passed DIBCAC):**
> "DIBCAC was ok when we showed them our change management process handled all of that"

**Richard:**
> "Looking at 3.4.5, I keep heading down one path, then changing my mind, because it is a confusingly written requirement. It is obvious that it is concerned with 'access restrictions' that are limiting the things that allow 'changes to organizational systems.' So, this does sound like any sort of change management requirement. Instead, it focuses on the restrictions to things that allow system changes to be made. (The example in the AG will easily lead somebody down a wrong road.)"

**thwackooey:**
> "The AG for 3.4.5 mentions 'logical access control that prevents unauthorized users from logging onto a system to make configuration changes (e.g., requiring specific credentials for modifying configuration settings, patching software, or updating software libraries)'. That sounds less like a change management system and more like configuring levels of access."

**Spock67, CCA:**
> "Inheritance for the FedRAMP cloud solutions, and Remote Work Policy, or Acceptable Use policy that covered any needed physical security in the home. Disallow printing because that adds all kinds of complications if the business operations can support that"

> "I would just address reasonably in your policy. Keep the laptop secure (one locked door sufficient) when not in use. Prevent shoulder surfing. Etc"

> "Use your power of definition here. It says you have to write the fundamental definition of what fits."

**Uncouth, CCP:**
> "Consider this alongside 3.4.2 - how do you define security relevant settings?"
> "How do you define least privilege and least functionality?"
> "These all tie together"
> "You have a lot of power in how you define these things"

## Interpretation Notes

1. **Control is confusingly written** - Multiple experts acknowledge this leads people down wrong paths
2. **AG examples can be misleading** - Explicitly stated by Lead CCA
3. **Two valid interpretations exist:**
   - Change management focused: Part of 3.4.3 change process
   - Access restriction focused: Who has credentials/physical access to make changes
4. **DIBCAC accepts change management approach** - Documented successful assessment
5. **Definition power:** Organizations have significant latitude in defining scope of "changes" covered
6. **Ties to other controls:** 3.4.1 (baseline), 3.4.2 (security-relevant), 3.4.3 (change management), 3.1.x (access controls)
