**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.2 access to CUI on system media is limited to authorized users.

## Sufficient

### Physical Controls and Secure Storage
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- 32 CFR 2002 requires organizations to create a "controlled environment" using physical barriers and procedural controls
- Secure storage and "direct physical control" (in a bag, on my person, etc.) should suffice
- A written policy alone is NOT enough - need actual physical controls

### Relationship to 3.8.1
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- 3.8.2 focuses on locking up racks and server rooms (system media)
- 3.8.1 focuses on CUI storage cabinets in each office
- Process for issuing encrypted thumb drives as the only authorized ones overlaps both

Per Tarnish (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- 3.8.2 adds "make sure the folks in possession of the media are authorized to have it in the first place"
- IT folks might be authorized to handle 3.8.1 dimensions but not authorized to access CUI data (3.8.2)

### Overlap with AC Domain
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- The AC, MP, and PE families all talk about authorizing and subsequently restricting access
- They operate within different topical scopes

## Insufficient

### Policy-Only Approach
Question: "Can we create a policy that just says 'do not use system media that contains CUI if you are not authorized'?"

Response (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):
- "I don't think a written policy is enough"
- Need actual secure storage and direct physical control mechanisms

## Over-engineering

## Edge Cases

### Distinguishing IT Staff Access
Per Tarnish (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- Some personnel (like IT folks) might be authorized to handle media physically (3.8.1)
- But may not be authorized to access the CUI data on that media (3.8.2)
- This is an important distinction for access control

---

## Evidence Examples

- Server room/rack access controls
- Documentation of who is authorized to access CUI on media
- Encrypted thumb drive issuance process
- Physical access logs to areas with system media
- Policy distinguishing physical handling authorization from data access authorization

## Key Quotes

> "32 CFR 2002 requires orgs to create a 'controlled environment' that uses a combo of physical barriers and procedural controls to prevent unauthorized access to CUI. This would include system media containing CUI. I don't think a written policy is enough. Secure storage and 'direct physical control' (in a bag, on my person, etc.) should suffice."

> "Secure storage, and personal accountability for media when it isn't in storage."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "The AC, MP, and PE families all talk about authorizing and subsequently restricting access, just within different topical scopes."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "On 3.8.2 looking at the system media aspect I focus more on things like locking up racks and server rooms, whereas with 3.8.1 I focus on our CUI storage cabinets in each office."
