# 3.1.20 - Expertise Overlay
## Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external systems

---

## Sufficient

### Scope Definition
- **Focus on CUI/FCI-relevant connections only**: Jake (Fellow) clarified that "y'all are going way too wide" when discussing listing every external connection. The control is "about protecting CUI, not all external connections. What external connections allow access back in, or are you sending CUI to?" (Glenda gave this a "this" reaction confirming agreement)
- **Create a discrete list of external connections**: List specific business, IT, and security functions that use external services. Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor) described creating "a dozen or so specific business, IT, and security functions" rather than every internet connection.
- **Categorize connections by CMMC scoping**: Each external connection should be characterized as CRMA, SPA, or CUIA per scoping guidance.

### AO (a) - Connections Identified
- Maintain a documented list of external system connections with scoping categorization
- Include FedRAMP Package IDs where applicable (e.g., "GCCH is FedRAMP High, Package ID FR1824057433. DUO is FedRAMP Moderate, Package ID FR1823149273")
- Subscription invoices acceptable as evidence of connection identification
- Signing into the account/console acceptable as demonstration evidence

### AO (b) - Use Identified
- Policy document stating the approved use of external systems (e.g., "use of gcc high is to store, process, transmit fci/cui") - confirmed as "good" by Glenda (Lead CCA)
- Firewall logs showing actual connections/traffic

### AO (c) - Connections Verified
- FedRAMP authorization status verifies the connection security
- Policy statement that cloud service providers used to s/p/t FCI will be "either fedramp moderate equivalent or be cmmc level 2 certified" (received clap reaction from Glenda)
- Blacklisting approach acceptable: "verification as Not Blocked in our FW rules"

### AO (d) - Use Verified
- Policy document stating "users are to use only company approved external systems (i.e. gcc high) to s/p/t fci and the use of non approved external system is prohibited" (received clap reaction from Glenda)

### AO (e) and (f) - Controlled/Limited
- Firewall rules conduct "verification, control and limiting"
- Always-on VPN for remote laptops to drive traffic through firewall controls
- Content filtering policies on firewall "for all zones (vpn, wlan, lan) to block all websites of certain categories and allow the rest"
- Windows Firewall rules on endpoints "blocking all incoming connections and allowing outgoing connections for certain ports"

---

## Insufficient

### Common Misunderstandings Corrected
- **Duo/MFA is NOT evidence for AO (a)**: "DUO validates the access to your system, not access to external systems. GCC High is a system you use, one of those external connections"
- **Non-FedRAMP SPAs are problematic**: If using OKTA or other SPA connections that are not FedRAMP or CMMC certified, they may need to be eliminated. Spock67 noted: "We are giving OKTA may go as we are not using the FedRAMP version"

### Control Gaps Identified
- Remote laptops are a "hole, potentially" if traffic is not controlled through VPN or endpoint firewall
- Training users to "connect to the company vpn...before they begin any work" is weaker than always-on VPN

---

## Over-engineering

### Going Too Wide on Scope
- **Do NOT list every website users visit**: "If every website that involves business processes (including bank and all suppliers), that is much bigger than I had planned for. That could get extreme quick."
- **Focus on SaaS and similar connections**: "I had only planned a small number of sites (focuses on SaaS and similar)"
- **Bank websites classified as CRMA or out of scope**: Unless sending CUI to them, bank connections are not the focus of this control

### Discussed But Deemed Excessive
- Listing "100s of websites" is not necessary
- Tracking every .mil/.gov connection individually is not required - can use "a general .mil and .gov listed connection that includes things like DoD SAFE"

---

## Edge Cases

### Remote/Traveling Laptops
- Classification of remote laptops as CRMAs with Windows firewall rules blocking incoming connections is one approach
- Users trained to connect to company VPN before work - but this relies on user behavior
- Always-on VPN provides better assurance
- Cloud FW (e.g., Zscaler) mentioned as future consideration for "more assurance of coverage of the remote laptops"

### SPA Certification Requirements
- Non-FedRAMP SPAs are being eliminated by some organizations due to compliance risk
- Cloud SIEM, MSSP, IR Support services eliminated if not FedRAMP certified
- "Unfortunately this is lowering our overall security posture but now view the compliance risk as greater"

### FCI vs CUI Scope
- Control applies to both FCI and CUI (confirmed "Both" by Glenda)

---

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence Discussed
1. **List of external connections** in spreadsheet with CMMC scoping categorization (CRMA, SPA, CUIA)
2. **Subscription invoices** showing purchase of approved services (e.g., GCC High, Duo FedRAMP)
3. **Firewall logs** (in SIEM or on appliance) showing traffic
4. **Firewall rules** demonstrating blocking/allowing
5. **Policy documents** stating:
   - Approved external systems for FCI/CUI
   - Requirement to use only approved systems
   - Prohibition on non-approved external system use
6. **FedRAMP Package IDs** for cloud services used
7. **Console login** to demonstrate connection exists

### Evidence Process (Glenda's Socratic Method)
- How did you identify the connection?
- Did someone ask you to set it up?
- What proof do you have that you chose to purchase and use the service?
- Show subscription invoices or sign into the account

## Key Quotes

> "This will end up being one of the tougher security requirements based on the scoping guide and the new rule implementation." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "y'all are going way too wide on that...this is about protecting CUI, not all external connections. What external connections allow access back in, or are you sending CUI to?" - Jake (Fellow)

> "[a] connections to external systems are identified; So theoretically that could be every internet connection by every system anywhere. I dont interpret it that way." - Spock67

> "DUO validates the access to your system, not access to external systems. GCC High is a system you use, one of those external connections; possibly your most significant one." - Spock67

> "GCCH is FedRAMP High, Package ID FR1824057433. List that. DUO is FedRAMP Moderate, Package ID FR1823149273." - Spock67

> "[d]-[f] as I say I think your Firewall conducts the verification, control and limiting, and use limiting through the establishment of FW rules. The hole, potentially, is laptops that are remote." - Spock67

> "I already eliminated our Cloud SIEM, MSSP, IR Support and several other things that were SPA connections but not FedRAMP or CMMC certified (and not going to be)." - Spock67

> "Unfortunately this is lowering our overall security posture but now view the compliance risk as greater." - Spock67

> "This control definitely needs more clarity." - rafaAmd101 (expressing common frustration with vague assessment guidance)

## Assessor Insight: Assessment Dynamics

Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor) provided candid commentary on assessment challenges:

> "If we execute it as written everyone will fail. Including most especially the super majors. That will not be tolerated. So. I predict a race to the bottom on actually holding the letter of the law."

This suggests assessors recognize the control as challenging and there may be practical interpretation flexibility in actual assessments.
