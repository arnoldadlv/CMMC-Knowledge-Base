# 3.1.19 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.19[a] mobile devices and mobile computing platforms that process, store, or transmit CUI are identified.
- 3.1.19[b] encryption is employed to protect CUI on identified mobile devices and mobile computing platforms.

## Sufficient

**Terminology Clarification (Certified Assessor - Spock67):**
- "Mobile Devices" = cell phones and tablets
- "Mobile Computing Platforms" = laptops
- This is explicit NIST terminology - 3.1.19 covers BOTH categories

**Encryption Approaches Discussed:**
- BitLocker for Windows devices with keys stored in Intune (evidence of centralized key management)
- Full-disk encryption (FDE) for Linux laptops
- Intune MAM (Mobile Application Management) in GCC-High for iOS/Android - containerizes data within Office apps using app protection policies
- App data protection policies can require encryption within the container

**Asset Identification:**
- Asset inventory spreadsheet identifying all devices authorized to access CUI (CUI enclave approach)

---

## Insufficient

**Linux Laptops Without FDE:**
- One participant noted Linux laptops need to be "reloaded to enable FDE" - this was acknowledged as a gap requiring remediation

**Laptops Claimed as "Desktops" (Edge Case):**
- Attempting to argue laptops that "never leave the building" are not mobile computing platforms is risky
- Per Lead CCA (Glenda R. Snodgrass): The Assessment Guide Level 2 explicitly states: "You are in charge of mobile device security for a company that processes CUI. You configure all laptops to use the full-disk encryption technology built into the operating system."
- "You *might* get an assessor to let you pass on this if you have a written policy that they never leave the building and users are trained on it, but I'd deffo ask about that in the interview process"

## Edge Cases

**Devices Not Intended to Store/Process/Transmit CUI:**
- Question: Do mobile devices need encryption/MDM if not intended for CUI?
- Lead CCA (Glenda R. Snodgrass): "You don't have to secure your devices at a level to handle the case of CUI spillage that is not your fault. If your policy is not to have CUI sent or received via email, and those devices don't have any other way to access CUI (e.g., SharePoint) then they are out of scope for CMMC."

**CRMA Consideration (Assessor Nuance):**
- Certified Assessor (Spock67) modulated this: "If they connect to the system, then they might be considered CRMA unless there is a physical or logical separation. The evaluation of CRMA is very subjective based on the wording in the regulation."
- Recommendation: "Look for opportunities to put other technical controls in place (like using InTune inherent functionality) to make the case better to an assessor."

**Email System Scoping:**
- If email is NOT part of the CUI environment (policy states no CUI via email), devices connecting only to that email system may be out of scope
- Lead CCA: "If we are going to say that any device that could accidentally get CUI from another org is CRMA, then the whole Internet is in scope again."
- Key test (Spock67): "Is email physically or logically separated from the in scope CUI system. If it is then out of scope."

**Laptops Used as Desktops:**
- A laptop is inherently mobile regardless of how it is used
- Trying to exempt laptops from mobile encryption requirements because "they never leave the building" requires C3PAO agreement during scoping discussions
- Recommendation: Discuss during C3PAO selection/interview process

## Evidence Examples

**Acceptable Evidence Mentioned:**
- Asset inventory spreadsheet listing all devices authorized to access CUI
- BitLocker keys stored in Intune (centralized key management proof)
- Intune app protection policy configurations showing encryption requirements
- Microsoft Guide for "Understanding App Data Protection" for FIPS 140-2 validation details on mobile platforms

**FIPS 140-2 Consideration:**
- For iOS/Android encryption via Intune MAM, reference the Microsoft documentation on cryptography methods and which are FIPS 140-2 validated

## Key Quotes

**On Mobile Device vs. Mobile Computing Platform Distinction:**
> "This is a NIST speak issue. Mobile Devices (cell phones and tablets). Mobile computing platforms (laptops)." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On 3.1.18 vs 3.1.19:**
> "18 is about inventory the devices and have controls on their connections plus log them. 19 is about encryption on both cell phones and laptops if they have CUI (basically). Really very different" - Spock67

**On iOS/Android Encryption via Intune:**
> "If you use Intune MAM within GCC-High, it containerizes the data within the Office apps using app protection policies and keeps the data encrypted. On the app data protection policy you can require the encryption or disable it as desired." - edcooey (CCP)

**On Scoping Mobile Devices Without CUI:**
> "You don't have to secure your devices at a level to handle the case of CUI spillage that is not your fault." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On CRMA Considerations:**
> "If they connect to the system, then they might be considered CRMA unless there is a physical or logical separation. The evaluation of CRMA is very subjective based on the wording in the regulation." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On C3PAO Alignment:**
> "This is a good example of choosing your C3PAO with care, and making sure they agree with this scoping decision in your initial discussions with them. You will have to clearly demonstrate that email is not in your CUI environment and they will have to agree with you." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On Laptops as Desktops:**
> "You *might* get an assessor to let you pass on this if you have a written policy that they never leave the building and users are trained on it, but I'd deffo ask about that in the interview process." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)
