# 3.3.9 - Expertise Overlay
## Limit management of audit logging functionality to a subset of privileged users

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.3.9[a] a subset of privileged users granted access to manage audit logging functionality is defined.
- 3.3.9[b] management of audit logging functionality is limited to the defined subset of privileged users.

## Sufficient

**Small company with all sysadmins having log management access:**
- A 3-person company where 1 person manages/configures the SIEM and that same person plus 1 other reviews logs (including each other's activities) is likely sufficient
- Certified Assessor (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA) stated: "I don't think most assessors would fail a 3-person company doing this"
- Second Certified Assessor (Spock67) agreed with this position
- The practical reality that you cannot grant one person's "left side permissions and the right none" is recognized

**Mathematical definition of subset defense:**
- Arguing that "a subset is defined as a set containing ALL or some of the elements of another set" is technically correct
- One practitioner referenced the Zermelo-Fraenkel subset axiom in their SSP (untested at assessment, but considered a valid approach)
- The Discussion section of the Assessment Guide is "not supposed to add additional requirements" beyond the assessment objectives

## Insufficient

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

**Very small organizations (1-3 sysadmins):**
- The primary discussion centers on organizations with only 1-2 sysadmins where true separation of duties is impossible
- Backup coverage requirements mean both admins need log management access
- Two Global Admins (GAs) reviewing each other's activities along with all other user activity during log review appears acceptable
- The key is having the subset DEFINED, even if the subset equals the entire IT staff

---

## Evidence Examples

**Acceptable evidence patterns (inferred from discussion):**
- SSP documentation defining who has audit log management access (even if it's all IT staff)
- Log review records showing privileged users reviewing each other's audit-related activities
- SIEM configuration showing which accounts have management access

## Key Quotes

> "What do small companies with 1-2 sysadmins do here? Should I attempt to make the case that due to the small size of personnel and the need to have coverage, we are using the definition of a subset that a subset is defined as a set containing ALL or some of the elements of another set?" - esprit

> "I'm in a similar boat and have taken a similar tack. I have no ideal how well it will survive assessment, but it was fun to reference the Zermelo-Fraenkel subset axiom in my SSP." - JB

> "We r a 3 people company and we have 1 guy who manages and configures the SIEM AND that same guy and 1 other person review logs of everyone and each other." - rafaAmd101

> "I think that's fine. It's not like you can grant the 1 IT persons left side permissions and the right none." - scotty, CCP (Certified CMMC Professional)

> "I don't think most assessors would fail a 3-person company doing this." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Agree." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
