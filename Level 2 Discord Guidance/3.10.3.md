# 3.10.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.10.3[a] visitors are escorted.
- 3.10.3[b] visitor activity is monitored.

## Sufficient

### Visitor vs. Authorized Personnel Distinction
- **Personnel who need regular access are NOT visitors** - they are third-party personnel. If they can access your facility but cannot access CUI, you've done your job. Add them to facility access list marked as contractor/tenant/third-party/vendor.
- **Cleared personnel with active VARs (Visit Authorization Requests) on file can be considered "authorized personnel"** rather than visitors, avoiding the escort requirement. VARs provide validation of clearance level and legitimate business purpose.
- **Janitors/cleaning crews are generally NOT considered visitors** - they can be authorized as third-party personnel if properly vetted. Key question: can they access CUI?
- **Sublease tenants and contract program managers** who are badged as contractors are not visitors if they cannot access CUI.

### Small Company Considerations
- Small companies (5-10 people who know each other) may not need badges to identify visitors - they can easily recognize who is authorized.
- **There is no specific headcount line** that requires badges. The test is demonstrating to assessors how your organization limits access.
- Ultimate test: Can you show training on identifying unauthorized individuals? Can you show signed agreements outlining steps to prevent unauthorized access?

### Escort Monitoring Methods
- Person escorting the visitor IS the monitoring - they ensure safeguarding of CUI.
- Cameras on entrances can supplement visitor monitoring and provide time-out tracking.
- Visitor badges on lanyards help as easy visual indicator of who does not belong.
- Colored lanyards provide quick visual identification of visitor status.

### No Screening Requirements for CMMC
- **No screening requirements for visitors for CMMC** - escort and monitoring IS the protection.
- ITAR may have additional entanglements (I-9 verification, CSL screening).

---

## Insufficient

### Unvetted Third-Party Access Without Controls
- Cleaning vendors entering after hours with no staff present AND no CUI protections in place (locked media, encrypted drives, screensavers) - problematic if company cannot ensure CUI won't be accessed.
- If CUI is not locked up when unattended, then after-hours personnel (janitors) need basic CUI training.
- Anonymous cleaning vendors where management company won't provide names - cannot authorize as third-party personnel without knowing who they are.

### Policy Wording Issues
- Don't say cleared personnel with VARs are "exempted from this policy" - they're not visitors. Word them as authorized personnel instead.

## Over-engineering

No explicit over-engineering discussions found in the channel. Discussions focused on meeting requirements practically.

## Edge Cases

### VAR (Visit Authorization Request) Personnel
- VARs are mandatory for classified visits - security manager sends VAR to receiving facility providing validation of clearance level and legitimate business purpose.
- VARs can be sent for a year, not just single visits.
- At big primes, **classified VAR commonly meets PS controls for no-escort badges**.
- These personnel should be defined as "authorized personnel" not "visitors" - use policy definitions to your advantage.
- Consider calling their badges "No Escort Required badges" or "temporary access badges" rather than "visitor badges" for CUI environment.

### Classified + CUI Environment Overlap
- A classified space IS also a CUI environment.
- May have CUI-only badges (uncleared) and CUI+Classified badges.
- Regulations around classified spaces call them "visitor badges" - but for CMMC purposes, define them as authorized personnel.

### Partner Contractors
- Other subs on your contract or contractors on separate contracts supporting same program - they have their own DFARS/800-171/CMMC requirements.
- You can describe these contractor types, how you know they're compliant via supply chain requirements, and how you identify them as authorized.

### Building Shared with Non-CUI Personnel
- Corporate employees outside CUI division accessing building where CUI work is done.
- If offices are locked, labs are badge-controlled, and they cannot access CUI systems - can be authorized with proper vetting.
- Citizenship verification may suffice for ITAR; background checks not explicitly required.
- Screening type is an ODP - check DD-254 for unique requirements, ensure not sanctioned, document HR screening process.

### Badging for Small vs. Large Organizations
- 10 people who know each other for years - probably don't need badges.
- 5-person company with high turnover - badges may be easier for identification.
- 1000+ employees - badges effectively required for practical identification.
- Badging alone isn't enough - still need authorized user lists, roles and responsibilities, signed agreements.

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence
- Facility access list with personnel marked as contractor/tenant/third-party/vendor
- Training records on identifying unauthorized individuals
- Signed agreements on steps to prevent unauthorized access
- Visitor log with sign-in/sign-out (sticker badges can serve as logbook)
- VAR records for cleared visitors granted no-escort access
- Badge system records showing who has access
- Camera footage at entrances for time tracking
- Policy defining who qualifies as "authorized personnel" vs. "visitor"

### Visitor Badge Options Discussed
- Generic visitor badges on lanyard (preferred over stickers)
- Sticker badges with logbook built-in - acceptable but impractical for high-volume facilities
- Colored lanyards for easy visual identification (not required, but useful)
- Lanyard badges prompt sign-out when returned

> "'are exempted from this policy.' - I wouldn't say that. they're not visitors. find a way to word those VARs to be authorized personnel" - Uncouth (Fellow/CCP)

> "you still have the power of definition, it is what you want it to be. I'd try to define it as what you're already doing, get as much credit for that as you can" - Uncouth

> "It is common at the big primes to consider a classified VAR as meeting the PS controls for no escort badges." - MonkSecurity (CCP)

> "This is still the read. If you're also ITAR registered, then your screening should include I-9 verification and screening against the CSL. If there's no guarantee CUI won't be locked up, then the janitors need to complete any basic CUI training you provide other employees." - rybo
