# 3.8.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Protect (i.e., physically control and securely store) system media containing CUI, both paper and digital.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.1[a] paper media containing CUI is physically controlled.
- 3.8.1[b] digital media containing CUI is physically controlled.
- 3.8.1[c] paper media containing CUI is securely stored.
- 3.8.1[d] digital media containing CUI is securely stored.

## Sufficient

### NIST Definition of Media
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- Use the NIST Glossary for definitions: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary
- NIST 171 definition: "Physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, Large-Scale Integration (LSI) memory chips, and printouts (but not including display media) onto which information is recorded, stored, or printed within a system"
- When multiple definitions exist, use the 171 definition first, then 800-53

### Overlap with 3.8.2
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- 3.8.1 focuses on CUI storage cabinets in each office
- 3.8.2 focuses on locking up racks and server rooms
- Encrypted thumb drives issued as the only authorized removable media overlaps both controls

## Edge Cases

### Workstation/Server Hard Drives
Question: "Does 3.8.1 cover workstation/server hard drives and other things in that category as well?"

Response (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- 3.8.1 seems heavily concerned with USB drives, physical copies, etc.
- 3.13.16 covers CUI at rest more specifically
- Look to NIST definition of "media" which includes magnetic disks and LSI memory chips

---

## Evidence Examples

- CUI storage cabinets with locks
- Physical access controls for areas containing CUI media
- Procedures for physical control of paper CUI
- Policy for secure storage of digital media
- Inventory of removable media containing CUI

## Key Quotes

> "I would look to the definition of Media from NIST for this. I have the NIST Glossary on my hot list and use it a lot for this sort of thing."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "In those cases I recommend going with the 171 definition if available, then the 800-53 definition if no 171 definition exists."
