# 3.5.7 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Enforce a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new passwords are created.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.5.7[a] password complexity requirements are defined.
- 3.5.7[b] password change of character requirements are defined.
- 3.5.7[c] minimum password complexity requirements as defined are enforced when new passwords are created.
- 3.5.7[d] minimum password change of character requirements as defined are enforced when new passwords are created.

## Sufficient

### Approved SSP Example (DIBCAC Passed)
Per ace_rimmer (Fellow), from approved SSP:
- "Active Directory enforces password complexity and password change controls. Password complexity requirements are 3 of the 4-character types (Uppercase Alpha, Lowercase Alpha, Number, Special Character), and passwords must be at least 8 characters in length. All changed passwords are required to have at least one character different from the previous password."
- This passed DIBCAC assessment with MFA and no required password change period

### MFA with Non-Expiring Passwords
Per ace_rimmer (Fellow):
- "Any account with MFA should have a never expires password IMO"
- Has passed assessment with this approach

### Minimum Character Length Evolution
Per marieramsay (Moderator/Fellow):
- While 8 characters was the minimum, best practices have evolved
- Example justification: "Although our current guidelines say that min characters are 8, this guidance was created in 2012, and over the last decade, this best practice has evolved. Therefore, the new min PW characters to be enforced is 15"

## Insufficient

### 8 Character Passwords (Security Perspective)
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "Your currently policy if written and enforced is compliant. It is also awful but not for the 365 day reason... The real problem is the 8 characters. That is horrid. It was adequate in 1995. It is no longer adequate."
- While compliant with CMMC, 8 characters is a security weakness

## Edge Cases

### Password Expiration Debate
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "Carnegie Mellon tried to go without setting a forced time period for reset and were hit on that by DIBCAC. Carnegie Mellon was unable, based on research data and NIST position, to argue them out of having at least some forced password reset period. I set mine at annual with everything else."

However, ace_rimmer (Fellow) responded:
- "Which AO requires a forced password change?"
- His organization passed with no required password change and MFA

Conflicting experiences suggest DIBCAC interpretation may vary.

### NIST Guidance on Password Expiration
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "There is some research from NIST that now recommends never forcing a password reset on a schedule. I am not sold on that but there is evidence that shorter time frames actually increase the risk rather than decrease it."

Referenced: NIST SP 800-63B

## Evidence Examples

- Active Directory password policy settings
- GPO configuration showing complexity requirements
- Documentation of defined password requirements
- Evidence that password change requirements include at least one character difference
- SSP section documenting password policy
- NIST SP 800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines) as reference
