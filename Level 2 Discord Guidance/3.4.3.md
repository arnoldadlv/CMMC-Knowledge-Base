# 3.4.3 - Expertise Overlay
## Control Text
Track, review, approve or disapprove, and log changes to organizational systems

## Assessment Objectives
- 3.4.3[a] changes to the system are tracked.
- 3.4.3[b] changes to the system are reviewed.
- 3.4.3[c] changes to the system are approved or disapproved.
- 3.4.3[d] changes to the system are logged.

## Sufficient

### Small Organization Approach (3-person company example that passed self-assessment review)
- Technical person proposes changes, reviewed in meeting with all team members
- Review meeting includes justification for the change
- Log when meeting took place and who attended (Excel sheet acceptable)
- Document what changes were made, to what platform, by whom, and when
- Document who approved or disapproved the changes
- Document if testing was required prior to implementation
- Document security impact (high, medium, low, none)
- Include screenshots of changes made with descriptions

### Tiered Approach for Minor Changes
- Per Certified CMMC Assessor (Glenda R. Snodgrass): "I also don't believe that every single change needs to go before the CMB ahead of time. Small things can simply be logged and added to a periodic report of changes. If the CMB has concerns, they can investigate."
- CM approvers can receive a digest of minor changes as part of continuous monitoring
- This approach should be captured in policy/SSP

### Temporary/Troubleshooting Changes
- Per Certified CMMC Assessor: "Log it. Even if it's just logged as a response in the trouble ticket, that's fine. But log it somewhere."
- Must have documentation/statement or procedure defining what allows for emergency changes
- Define who can make emergency changes happen
- Define where/what gets logged

### Emergency Changes
- Can have "emergency" scenarios where action is taken first
- Approval can occur after the fact if documented that way in procedures

## Edge Cases

### Permission Changes (Folder/SharePoint Access)
**Question**: "If I grant a user new permissions to a folder or SharePoint site, would you consider that a change that needs to follow this process?"

**Assessor Response** (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA):
- If user is being granted permission normally outside their current role: YES, follow change management process
- Think of it as the "Requirement Loop: Authorize, Implement, Audit"
- Risk-based consideration:
  - "More of the same kind of access" = less concerning
  - "New kind of access, especially something that might interfere with important security considerations like SOD" = investigate further

### Small Org / Single Technical Person Dilemma
**Question**: "In a small organization where the person who proposes the change is the only one who has the technical skills to review the change, this requirement is almost nonsensical."

**Community Response**: Include non-technical team members in review meetings to discuss justification and document the process. The review is about understanding the need and impact, not just technical verification.

### What Types of Changes Require Change Control?
- Noted as a gap in 800-53 to 800-171 port: "This is one of my least favorite 53->171 ports because it drops the part about determining the types of changes which need change control."
- Community acknowledges lack of clear guardrails on this topic
- General observation: Configuration management processes may be too "tech-focused" - should consider broader changes including permissions

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence Discussed
- Excel spreadsheet with:
  - Meeting date and attendees for change proposals
  - Description of changes made
  - Platform affected
  - Who made the change and when
  - Who approved/disapproved
  - Whether testing was required
  - Security impact rating (high/medium/low/none)
  - Screenshots with descriptions
- Trouble ticket with change logged as response
- Periodic digest/report of minor changes to CMB

## Key Quotes

### From Amira Armond (C3PAO, CMMCAudit.org)
> "We've noticed that it is rare for small companies to understand government expectations for Change Management"

### From Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)
On permission changes:
> "If a user is being granted a permission that is normally outside the perms for their current role, yes, I would expect this process to be followed. Think of this as the Requirement Loop: Authorize, Implement, Audit."

On tiered review approach:
> "I also don't believe that every single change needs to go before the CMB ahead of time. Small things can simply be logged and added to a periodic report of changes. If the CMB has concerns, they can investigate."

On temporary changes:
> "Log it. Even if it's just logged as a response in the trouble ticket, that's fine. But log it somewhere."

On risk-based evaluation:
> "I think it would depend on the security risk posed by the unapproved permissions. If it's just giving more of the same kind of access, I wouldn't be too worried. If it's giving a new kind of access, especially something that might interfere with important security considerations like SOD, I'd want to know more."

### From marieramsay (Moderator, Fellow)
On emergency/temporary changes:
> "And have documentation/a statement or a procedure defining what allows for this... (And who can make it happen). And then, like Glenda says, where/what is logged."

### From pilotjp
On emergency changes:
> "You can think you can have 'emergency' scenarios where you do something, but then you can still have the approval after the fact if it's documented that way"
