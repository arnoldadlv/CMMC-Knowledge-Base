# 3.14.4 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.

**Assessment Objective:** Determine if malicious code protection mechanisms are updated when new releases are available.

---

## Sufficient

- Proof that endpoint protection agents running on workstations are updated is sufficient evidence for this control
- For platforms with automatic updates: documentation from vendor knowledgebase describing the definition update behavior, combined with a screenshot showing the configuration, is acceptable

## Insufficient

No discussion found.

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Automatic update platforms:** When endpoint protection platforms automatically update their agents, it can be tricky to prove compliance. The automatic nature means there may not be obvious "proof" in the traditional sense - you need to demonstrate the auto-update capability is enabled and functioning.

## Evidence Examples

- Screenshots of endpoint agent versions showing they are current
- Vendor knowledgebase documentation describing automatic definition update behavior
- Screenshots showing auto-update configuration is enabled in the platform
