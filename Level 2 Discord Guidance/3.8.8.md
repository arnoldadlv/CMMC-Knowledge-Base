# 3.8.8 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- Determine if the organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices that have no identifiable owner
- Verify that ownership is established and documented for all portable storage devices in use

---

## Sufficient

- **Organization-owned devices are acceptable** - The owner does not need to be an individual; the organization itself can be the owner. Devices are typically issued to employees by the company. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Flexible ownership assignment** - Devices can be assigned to a team, a facility, a work area, or an individual. The most common approach is assigning a drive to an individual and maintaining an inventory of who it was issued to. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **DLP solution with write restrictions** - A DLP solution that allows read-only for any USB device but only permits write access by exception (via the DLP solution) for organization-issued drives, combined with policy prohibiting use of non-issued USB drives, meets the control. (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor; Glenda R. Snodgrass, Fellow/Certified CMMC Assessor)

- **Documentation of device assignment** - Document which device is issued to whom to establish ownership. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Fellow/Lead CCA/Certified CMMC Assessor)

---

## Insufficient

- **Allowing unidentified USB devices without restrictions** - Permitting any USB device to be used without establishing ownership or implementing technical controls would not meet the requirement.

- **Policy-only approach without technical controls** - While policy is important, relying solely on administrative policy without technical enforcement (like DLP) leaves gaps. The discussed approach combines both technical (read-only by default, write by exception) and administrative (policy, training) controls.

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Read-only access for unidentified devices** - One approach discussed allows read-only access for ALL USB devices (including unidentified ones) while restricting write access to only organization-issued devices. This is combined with administrative policy and employee training to prohibit use of "street" USB devices. (socketsetter, Certified CMMC Assessor, seeking clarification)

- **Team/facility-assigned devices** - Ownership does not require assignment to a specific named individual. A device can be assigned to a team, facility, or work area while still meeting the "identifiable owner" requirement. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

---

## Evidence Examples

- Inventory/asset list showing portable storage devices and their assigned owners (individuals, teams, or organizational units)
- DLP solution configuration showing read-only default with write-by-exception controls
- Policy documentation prohibiting use of non-issued USB devices
- Device issuance records showing which devices were issued to whom
- Employee training records on portable storage device policies

## Key Quotes

> "Org is fine. Individuals don't usually own the device. Instead, they are issued a company-owned device."
> - **rybo** (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "Not necessarily. I could see a device assigned to a team, a facility, a work area, you name it. Of course, the most common approach is to assign a drive to an individual and keep an inventory of who it was issued to."
> - **rybo** (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "Yes. That is pretty much the way I do it." [Referring to DLP solution with read-only default and write-by-exception for issued drives]
> - **Spock67** (Certified CMMC Assessor, CCP, Consultant)

> "Be sure to document which device is issued to whom and that sounds good to me."
