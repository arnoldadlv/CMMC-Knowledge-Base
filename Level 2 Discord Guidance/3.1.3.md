# 3.1.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorizations.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- [a] information flow control policies are defined
- [b] methods and enforcement mechanisms for controlling the flow of CUI are defined
- [c] designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) for CUI within the system and between interconnected systems are identified
- [d] authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are defined
- [e] approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are enforced

## Sufficient

### Policy + Training Approach (Small Organizations)
- Written policy outlining how to share CUI, combined with annual training on that policy
- Policy that employees train on outlining how to share CUI is acceptable for enforcement (AO [b])
- "Example 2 was provided to show how very small organizations can meet control requirements without breaking the bank buying technical solutions" - ervalex (CCA)

### Data Flow Diagram
- A data flow diagram (DFD) with brief explanation of source and destination of all CUI is acceptable evidence for AO [c]
- "Yes if you can get it down to a DFD that's awesome" - Jake (Fellow)

### DLP + Justification Logging Approach
- Approved users list who can send CUI email
- DLP prompts for justification when sending CUI-labeled email
- IT team receives notifications when CUI emails are sent
- Tracking sender, receiver, and justification
- Lead CCA response: "I'm mostly okay with this for 3.1.3. My only concern is SOD. Be sure that the authorize, implement and audit/monitor functions are all done by different individuals/groups."

### Microsoft Purview
- Sensitivity labels and policies to lock files from download to hard drives
- Prevent sharing with unauthorized users
- Force encryption during transmission

### Technical + Policy Combination
- Policy controls combined with technical controls:
  - Disabling external storage media
  - Disabling copy/paste on BYOD devices
  - Encryption
- Flowing down CMMC requirements to subcontractors via contracts

### Sources/Destinations for CUI
- Control focuses on WHERE CUI goes, not where ALL traffic goes
- List of sources and destinations for CUI is needed
- No requirement to list every web page users might access
- "Generally 443 and 80 are permitted open outbound to keep internet communication running" - Spock67 (CCA)

---

## Insufficient

### Example 2 from Assessment Guide Alone
- Example 2 only addresses flowing CUI from org to prime contractor
- Does NOT address internal flows
- Does NOT address flows to subcontractors
- "Example 2 only addresses flowing CUI from your org to the prime contractor. What about internally? What about your subs?" - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

### Assessment Guide Examples Are Not Prescriptive
- "Examples are not all-inclusive or prescriptive and do not imply any personal responsibility for complying with CMMC requirements" - quoted from Assessment Guide
- Cannot simply implement one example and assume compliance

### Policy-Only for Large Organizations
- "Small companies and/or small amounts of data, sure that's fine. Large orgs with lots of users devices data and the CCA will be expecting some technical solution involved." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

---

## Over-engineering

### Blocking All Public Internet Access
- Question: "Do I have to block public internet access in order to comply with this control?"
- Answer: "No." - Spock67 (CCA)
- One user tried to build ACL allowing only GCCH and few key sites - described as "huge undertaking" and unnecessary

### Whitelisting All Inbound Email Sources
- Question about whether to whitelist external email senders for inbound CUI
- Lead CCA reacted with "blobno" (rejection emoji) to suggestion of whitelisting inbound emails
- Control focuses on designated sources/destinations for CUI flow, not all email traffic

### Blocking Personal Email Sites
- Question: "Is anyone blocking users from accessing personal email sites?"
- Answer: "There are no controls that would require this. While it is a good security control to help make sure that data isn't sent out in an unapproved manner, you can do the same with policies" - Jake (Fellow)

---

## Edge Cases

### VDI/CRMA Architecture
- Discussed as valid approach for C3PAOs and larger enterprises
- VDI prevents need to move entire commercial environment into 800-171 compliance
- CRMAs can implement Level 1 controls only (FAR Basic Safeguarding)
- Tradeoff: "How much money do you really save by doing VDI? What parts of 800-171 are you not doing on your CRMAs?" - Jake (Fellow)
- VDI architecture is expensive but can prevent securing 10,000+ endpoints in full 800-171 environment

### ITAR/CUI Specified
- When handling ITAR data: "take the high-water approach and treat it all like ITAR data" - Jake (Fellow)
- CUI Specified may require different flow controls based on enhanced requirements

### ACL Enforcement Flexibility
- ACLs at perimeter boundaries and internal VLAN security boundaries
- Share permissions acceptable where risk is lower
- "The only place that absolutely requires logical separation is at the scope boundary"

### Policy-Only for Internet Uploads
- "Preventing CUI uploads to Internet sites is pretty high risk and all I have there is a written policy/training"
- Whether this is sufficient depends on organization size and context
- Consult C3PAO for guidance on threshold

### Separation of Duties (SOD) for DLP Workflows
- When using DLP with justification prompts, ensure SOD
- Authorize, implement, and audit/monitor functions should be done by different individuals/groups
