## Sufficient

- **CNSSI 1253 minimum event types** - Rybo (Moderator/Fellow) recommends using CNSSI 1253 as the source for minimum event types to log. This is an accepted baseline.
- **DISA STIG settings** - Modeled after CNSSI 1253, these settings should also meet FedRAMP Moderate values for event types and content.
- **OSC-defined logging requirements** - The organization gets to specify what logs are needed. Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor): "Logging requirements defined by you" and "Basically up to your judgement."
- **90-day retention minimum** - Discussed as the minimum needed for compliance purposes. MDE's 30-day retention alone is insufficient; need to extend via Sentinel or other means.
- **Sentinel with 90-day retention** - Can extend MDE's 30-day limit; confirmed MDE logging can be ingested into UAL which can be retained up to 10 years with E5 licenses.
- **Intune Settings Catalog with DISA STIG settings** - Configuration profiles pushed from Intune using Settings Catalog for Windows log settings is an accepted implementation approach.

## Insufficient

- **MDE 30-day retention alone** - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint only retains data for 30 days in advanced hunting; "would need to be able to query back at least 90 for it to be of any use from a retention standpoint."
- **Default Windows 10/11 baseline from Intune** - The "relatively bare bones default audit policy from the Windows 10 and later baseline provided in Intune" is insufficient; "it doesn't even include, for example, removable media event IDs."

## Over-engineering

- **Adding SYSMON** - Rybo mentions adding SYSMON for on-premise logs (e.g., NeQter) because "it doesn't cost anything to ingest and the sysmon data is valuable for detections" - but this is described as an enhancement beyond minimum requirements, not a compliance necessity.
- **File/record manipulation logs for confidentiality** - Per Uncouth (CCP): "171 is concerned with *confidentiality* of CUI. File/Record manipulation is more of an integrity control. Operationally important but not necessarily for compliance."

## Edge Cases

### Laptops as Mobile Devices
- **Consensus: Laptops are NOT mobile devices** - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor) confirms: "Laptops are not considered mobile devices as defined."
- NIST definition specifies "small form factor" and lists examples as "smartphones, tablets, and E-readers" - notably excluding laptops.
- Recommendation: "In my SSP I also consider laptops to be mobile computing platforms and put them in a different category."
- While modern laptops technically fit some criteria, "NIST's clear intent here was to form a definition that painted laptops out of the category."

### Auditing Failures for File Access (Linux)
- For Linux CUI baseline implementations with discrepancies between 800-53 moderate STIG and Defender tags: "You get to define what logs are needed."
- Argument accepted: Auditing failures for file access "aren't necessary to investigate incidents since they didn't impact the security of CUI or the systems operation."
- OSC can make judgment calls about what to specify as needed event types.

### GCC-High Limitations
- "Intune logs can be ingested into Sentinel in commercial but not GCCH" - organizations in GCC-High need alternative solutions for Intune log ingestion.

## Evidence Examples

- **Event type specification documentation** - List of audit logs/event types specified by the organization (demonstrates assessment objective [a])
- **Audit record content definition** - Documentation of what content audit records must contain (demonstrates [b])
- **Screenshots of generated audit records** - Evidence that audit records are being created (demonstrates [c])
- **Sample audit records showing defined content** - Evidence records contain required content (demonstrates [d])
- **Retention requirements documentation** - Defined retention periods (demonstrates [e])
- **Retention configuration evidence** - Screenshots showing retention settings meeting defined requirements (demonstrates [f])
- **Intune Settings Catalog configuration** - Configuration profiles showing audit policy settings
- **Azure Log Analytics agent deployment** - Evidence of log collection and forwarding to Log Analytics Workspace
- **Sentinel data connector configuration** - Evidence of M365/MDE log ingestion

> "This standard I wrote uses the minimum event types from CNSSI 1253." - Rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "We used DISA STIG settings, but those are modeled after 1253. They should also meet FedRAMP Moderate values for event types and content." - Rybo

> "Logging requirements defined by you... Basically up to your judgement" - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "I would argue that you get to define what logs are needed. 'AU.L2-3.3.1 [a] audit logs needed (i.e., event types to be logged) to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity **are specified**' So you can make a judgement call on what you specify as needed." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Laptops are not considered mobile devices as defined... I believe most assessors are aligned to that." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Although you could make an argument for the modern laptop, I think NIST's clear intent here was to form a definition that painted laptops out of the category." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
