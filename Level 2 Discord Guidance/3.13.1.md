# 3.13.1 - Expertise Overlay
## Monitor, control, and protect communications at external boundaries and key internal boundaries

**Source:** Cooey COE Discord - System and Communications Protection channel
**Messages Analyzed:** 68
**Date Range:** September 2022 - December 2025

## Sufficient

### For FCI-Only (Level 1) Environments
- **Windows Defender with built-in firewall** (deny all, permit by exception) is generally considered sufficient for FCI endpoints
  - "For FCI only, Windows Defender and the built-in firewall are generally considered sufficient." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

### For Cloud-Native Environments (GCCH)
- Host-based firewalls (Defender) with whitelisted inbound/outbound flow on AAD-joined/Intune-enrolled endpoints
- For work-from-home pure cloud environments: Host-based firewall + CSP (cloud service provider) as external boundaries
- "The FW and CSP are your external boundaries and no internal would be what I would say." - Lali Pap

### External Boundary Examples (Accepted)
- Firewall/router at network perimeter
- CSP managed gateway (for GCCH environments)
- Host-based firewalls on endpoints (especially for remote/WFH scenarios)
- VPN termination points

### Internal Boundary Examples (Accepted)
- VLAN segmentation separating CUI environment from rest of network
- WiFi network in CUI environment with different attack surface than wired (can be considered internal boundary)
- Potentially: SharePoint sites with limited access as logical separation (debated - see Edge Cases)

---

## Insufficient

### What Does NOT Meet This Control
- **Access control lists alone** without network-level boundary protection
  - "If access control was your only method of boundary control, ('we have no firewall but we have solid ACLs on our files') when you should realistically be *also* deploying firewalls based on your network, then you are missing the intent of the control" - Michael (Consultant)
- Physical security controls (badge readers, etc.) - these belong in 3.10, not 3.13.1
  - "I don't know anyone including physical security in this control." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

## Over-engineering

No explicit over-engineering examples were discussed in this channel.

## Edge Cases

### Small Organizations with No Internal Boundaries
- **Confirmed acceptable:** Many small organizations legitimately have no key internal boundaries
  - "Many small orgs don't have any internal boundaries at all." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA
  - "Small companies often dont have internal boundaries, its not unusual" - Lali Pap

### Cloud-Native (GCCH) Internal Boundaries
- Internal boundaries within GCCH likely inherited from CSP
- "The cloud provider probably has some that we can't see from the user side... But I would call that not applicable for the small biz graphic" - Amira Armond (C3PAO)
- For cloud-only with no physical network, "no internal boundary" is acceptable answer

### SharePoint Sites as Internal Boundaries (Debated)
- **One perspective:** Limited access SharePoint sites can be considered internal boundaries because they enforce logical separation similar to VLANs
  - "limiting access through groups is the same concept as creating a VLAN for your firewall" - Lali Pap
  - Glenda Snodgrass found this "an interesting perspective"
- **Counter perspective:** Access control on SharePoint is not the same as network boundary protection
  - "3.13.1 is talking about network connectivity and traffic flow and not data access/user permissions" - Michael
  - "I wouldn't call it an internal boundary if there is no physical or logical network segregation"
- **Resolution:** Controls can overlap; data access controls may contribute to 3.13.1 but you still need a firewall somewhere

### WiFi Networks
- Guest WiFi with no CUI access = Out of Scope (OOS)
- WiFi network in CUI environment = Could be considered an internal boundary due to different attack surface than wired

### Remote/Work From Home
- VPN is NOT strictly required but is a common way to meet controls
- Alternatives discussed: Always-on VPN, endpoint firewall, cloud firewall (Zscaler mentioned)
- "Regardless you need to account for the out of office connection and how you meet the requirements in that use case." - Spock67 (CCA)
- Can define as "Alternate Work Sites" with remote access policy and safeguarding measures

### Control vs. Protect Distinction
- **Control:** The means of managing risk, including policies, procedures, guidelines, practices, or organizational structures
- **Protect:** Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence Discussed
- Firewall configuration showing deny-by-default with explicit allow rules
- Intune policies showing:
  - Printing blocked
  - Removable storage blocked
  - Public cloud/personal email sites blocked (gmail, icloud, dropbox)
  - Outbound FTP/SFTP ports blocked
- DLP policies generating alerts for CUI-related keywords
- Purview Information Protection IRM sensitivity labels
- Network diagram showing boundary components
- Host-based firewall whitelists (inbound/outbound flow)

### Boundary Components (from NIST discussion text)
- Gateways
- Routers
- Firewalls
- Guards
- Network-based malicious code analysis systems (interpreted as: gateway antivirus)
- Network-based virtualization systems (interpreted as: SDN, SD-WAN, WAN optimization tools like Riverbed, SASE, SSE)
- Encrypted tunnels

## Key Quotes

### On Internal Boundaries
> "If your CUI environment is segmented from the rest of your network by a restricted VLAN, that would be a key internal boundary. Many small orgs don't have any internal boundaries at all."
> - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

> "That picture doesn't have key internal boundaries... The cloud provider probably has some that we can't see from the user side... But I would call that not applicable for the small biz graphic"
> - Amira Armond, CMMCAudit.org (C3PAO)

### On FCI vs CUI Requirements
> "For FCI only, Windows Defender and the built-in firewall are generally considered sufficient."
> - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

### On Remote Access/VPN
> "A VPN is not a requirement but it is a standard way of meeting some of the controls. If a remote employee is connecting to 'The System' as you have defined it, how is that connection controlled and managed?"
> - Spock67, CCA

### On NIST Terminology
> "When NIST uses generic language to describe specific technologies, we inherit language that doesn't quite fit our existing/planned systems. We understand Legos, not off-brand generalizations."
> - rybo (Moderator) explaining "network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems"

### On Control Intent
> "In the case of 3.13.1, you will need a firewall somewhere even if it's just your workstation."
> - Michael (Consultant)

### On Physical Security
> "Protecting Badge readers and Physical Security Devices is covered explicitly in 3.10"
> - MurdoxMobius

> "I don't know anyone including physical security in this control."
> - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

### On Cloud Tenant Interconnections
> "Is an ISA or MOU needed for interconnections between cloud tenants? - Not strictly today, but look at rev3 and the DOD defined Rev3 ODPs and you'll see it's coming."
> - Uncouth, CCP

## Assessment Objectives Reminder
From rybo (pinned message):
- 3.13.1[a] the external system boundary is defined
- 3.13.1[b] key internal system boundaries are defined
- 3.13.1[c] communications are monitored at the external system boundary
- 3.13.1[d] communications are monitored at key internal boundaries
- 3.13.1[e] communications are controlled at the external system boundary
- 3.13.1[f] communications are controlled at key internal boundaries
- 3.13.1[g] communications are protected at the external system boundary
- 3.13.1[h] communications are protected at key internal boundaries
