# 3.1.4 - Expertise Overlay
## Separation of Duties

**Control Text:** Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.4[a] the duties of individuals requiring separation are defined.
- 3.1.4[b] responsibilities for duties that require separation are assigned to separate individuals.
- 3.1.4[c] access privileges that enable individuals to exercise the duties that require separation are granted to separate individuals.

## Sufficient

### Small Company Implementations (2-3 people)
- **vCISO approach:** Hiring an outside person (even 1 hour/month) to perform auditing functions creates legitimate separation
- **Family business model:** Dividing tasks between family members with documented training is acceptable if you can demonstrate competence and authority
- **Three-person model (validated by CCA):**
  - Person 1: Global admin, manages configuration, access to CUI, heads IT. Changes require Person 2 approval. Reviews logs.
  - Person 2: Approves configuration changes. No CUI access, no log review.
  - Person 3: Global admin, no CUI access. Reviews logs for everyone including Person 1.
- **Two-person minimum:** Two people reviewing each other's activities and logs can meet the intent
- **MSP involvement:** Using MSP for oversight of configuration changes and post-implementation review, with executive approval through documented processes

### Key Separation Patterns
- **Authorizing, Doing, and Auditing should be separated** (cited by Lead CCA Glenda Snodgrass)
- Change approval separated from change execution
- Log review performed by someone other than the person being audited
- Configuration changes require approval from someone who cannot implement them

### Technical Controls That Support Sufficiency
- PIM (Privileged Identity Management) with approval workflows requiring justification
- IT Director or executive reviewing log review outputs for accuracy
- Sentinel alerts to prevent log tampering
- Entra ID logs are immutable (cannot be erased or deleted, only expired based on retention policies)
- Separating log deletion capability from IT Admins

### Role Documentation
- Define roles and responsibilities for each group **including what they cannot do**

---

## Insufficient

### Small Company Failures
- **Picking roles by convenience rather than capability** - Assigning duties based on family relationship rather than demonstrated competence
- **"Gundecking"** - Assigning duties on paper without actual authority or capability
- **General, vague statements** - A general "reasonable" statement about oversight will fail. Must define specific duties requiring separation
- **One person doing all IT work with no oversight** - Single IT person without any external verification mechanism
- **Self-reviewing your own logs** - If you do the log reviews and no one checks your work, you could "pull a fast one"

### Common Mistakes
- Defining separation duties that cannot actually be implemented
- Claiming someone has authority when they cannot actually exercise it (e.g., if Change Manager says "No" but company implements anyway)
- Not documenting training for personnel assigned separated duties

## Edge Cases

### Very Small Companies (2 people, married couple, family business)
- **Cannot rely on "been married 20 years" as justification** - Must still have formal separation
- **Cross-training scenario:** Paper CUI person audits Digital CUI person and vice versa - only works if each truly cannot access the other's domain
- **Functional vs Technical separation:** Splitting "policy creation vs policy enforcement" as one approach
- **Joint activities:** Making auditing a "joint activity" where both people must be present is an option, though hard to enforce

### The Auditing Paradox
- If functional role audits, they can cover their own bad acts
- If IT/admin role audits, they can cover their own bad acts
- IT admin can grant themselves auditing privileges
- **Solution:** External auditor (even minimal hours) or cross-audit with someone who genuinely cannot access your domain

### Multiple Global Admins
- Having two global admins who can access everything is acceptable for small companies IF:
  - They serve as each other's checks and balances
  - One focuses on implementation, other focuses on verification
  - A third person provides ultimate approval authority
  - Both review each other's activities in logs

### IT Director Without Technical Experience
- Can still serve separation role if they can review justifications and approve/reject requests in PIM
- Can review log review outputs even without deep technical knowledge

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence
- Change management logs showing who approved vs who implemented
- Log review records showing different person reviewing than person being audited
- Training records demonstrating competence for assigned duties
- PIM approval records with justifications
- Documentation of defined roles with responsibilities AND restrictions
- Evidence of authority being exercised (e.g., Change Manager rejecting a change)
- Weekly log reviews reviewed by supervisor/director

### Evidence Generation Methods Discussed
- Change management approval workflows with documented approvals
- MSP post-implementation configuration reviews
- Executive staff approval through meeting agenda items
- Sentinel alerts for log tampering attempts

## Key Quotes

### On Authority and Definition
> "The key concept here is 'authority.' You don't need to be a full-time employee or to have the title CIO to have authority. You just need to actually have the authority. So, if a non-traditional person (such as an external consultant) is the Change Manager, that is OK. But you need to show that they have authority."
> -- Amira Armond (C3PAO)

> "You need to be able to convince an assessor that the person is competent to do the job and has authority, and you aren't just gundecking."
> -- Amira Armond (C3PAO)

> "This gives you the power of definition. Use that power wisely. Define the duties requiring separation as something you can execute on. A general reasonable statement like yours will fail."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "The OSC has the power of definition and should use it wisely."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "The standard is silent on what duties should be separated."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

### On Purpose and Intent
> "The separation of duties is not necessarily to prevent something from happening so much as to make it difficult to hide that it happened, because someone else will see the tracks."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "I think the Intent of this control is not giving one individual unchecked power."
> -- rafaAmd101

> "We follow along the lines of Authorizing, Doing and Auditing should be separated."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

### On Scope
> "Everything in 800-171 applies only to your CUI environment. That's why scoping is critical."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "Shrinking the scope makes everyone's life easier!!!! It's the first thing I focus on with new clients."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

### On Small Business Realities
> "Lots of small businesses owners do not have admin rights on their own networks."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "You don't have to hire someone outside to handle day to day admin duties. The idea is that someone who doesn't do those tasks is in a position to verify what has been done day to day, and recognize illicit activity."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

### On Log Protection
> "What I like is separating the functionality for log deletion from IT Admins. That is what I do. It is both useful against insider threats and easy for me to implement. One thing the OSC must be careful about is not defining required separation where they cannot implement."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Also keep in mind that Entra ID logs are immutable. You can't erase or delete them; you can only wait for them to expire based on retention policies."
> -- rybo (Moderator)

> "I have actually had someone erase the SIEM logs to cover their tracks before."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

### On Assessment Guide Reference
> "If you see the latest assessment guide, it shows in the example section that having two people reviewing logs, meets the AO (c)."
> -- rafaAmd101
