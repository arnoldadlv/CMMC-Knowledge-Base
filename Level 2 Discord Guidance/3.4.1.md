# 3.4.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of organizational systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development life cycles.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.4.1[a] a baseline configuration is established.
- 3.4.1[b] the baseline configuration includes hardware, software, firmware, and documentation.
- 3.4.1[c] the baseline configuration is maintained (reviewed and updated) throughout the system development life cycle.
- 3.4.1[d] a system inventory is established.
- 3.4.1[e] the system inventory includes hardware, software, firmware, and documentation.
- 3.4.1[f] the inventory is maintained (reviewed and updated) throughout the system development life cycle.

## Sufficient

### Baseline Configuration Minimums
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow), at minimum baselines must include:
- Major edition/version information (including min/max version level)
- Names of any configuration items applied to this baseline (companywide PPSM, hardware requirements, etc.)
- All configuration-controlled settings

### Implementation Methods
Per Amira Armond (C3PAO/Fellow), acceptable baseline implementation methods include:
- Build procedures
- Standard image
- A collection of policies that push configurations
- The key test: "Are assets of the same type configured differently or not configured?"

### Small Organization Approach
- Use fewer baselines overall
- Use fewer operating systems and brands of equipment
- A spreadsheet works for smaller organizations (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor)

### Inventory Requirements
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- AOs require: hardware, software, firmware, and documentation
- Don't forget to include software on systems (not just hardware)
- Include links to documentation (online vendor docs for hardware/software)
- "People forget to include documentation"

---

## Insufficient

- Software inventory that exists but isn't pre-approved or controlled through GPO/Intune
- Per ace_rimmer (Fellow): "If you can't really control the install through GPO/Intune/etc then I think it's part of baseline"

---

## Over-engineering

### Single "Monster Baseline" for Entire System
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow), while you could build a monster baseline covering all components:
- 3.4.2 requires system settings in baseline configuration
- Would result in a very large document
- Each distinct component needs its own list of settings
- Not recommended for practical management

### Separate Configuration for Each Appliance
Spock67 questioned whether a separate documented configuration for each printer would make security better - consensus: probably not, and would be excessive documentation burden.

---

## Edge Cases

### Defining "The System"
Discussion about defining "the system" as the corporate network/enclave and creating baseline for entire system. This approach maps to hardware/software/firmware/documentation requirement but creates management complexity.

### Printers and Appliances
Spock67 raised the question of appliance baselines (e.g., printers). General view: Not every device needs its own separate documented configuration, but they should be covered under broader baseline categories.

---

## Evidence Examples

- Baseline configuration documents with version info and settings
- Standard image documentation
- GPO/Intune policy exports
- Inventory spreadsheet (for small organizations)
- Links to vendor documentation for hardware/software
- Configuration change logs

> "Baselining (the act of producing a baseline configuration) aims to compare a desired system state against the actual system state, and correct discrepancies as needed."

> "SMBs benefit from having fewer baselines overall. That's the best advice I can give. Use fewer operating systems and brands of equipment."

> "How you ensure the assets of same type have been configured the same (predictable) is the implementation"
> -- Amira Armond (C3PAO/Fellow)

> "May be build procedures. May be standard image. May be a bunch of policies that push"

> "The AOs say it must include hardware, software, firmware, and documentation. Those are the only requirements."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "A couple things to not miss. 1) This is not just about hardware. Software is included so you need to include the software on those systems. 2) Documentation. I recommend including a link to the SW online for the hardware or software related. People forget to include documentation."
