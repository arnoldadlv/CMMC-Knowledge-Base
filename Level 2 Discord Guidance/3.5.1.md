# 3.5.1 - Expertise Overlay
## Identify system users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.5.1[a] system users are identified.
- 3.5.1[b] processes acting on behalf of users are identified.
- 3.5.1[c] devices accessing the system are identified.

---

## Sufficient

**User Identification:**
- Username, email ID, or employee ID are acceptable identifiers for users
- Unique identifiers managed through AD/Entra ID

**Device Identification:**
- InTune-assigned device ID associated with manufacturer's serial number (satisfies both 3.5.1 and 3.5.5)
- MAC address for non-AD-joined/InTune managed devices
- NAC solution for device identification
- Organization defines method in policy/procedure for non-managed devices

**Process Identification:**
- Service accounts documented with their purpose (e.g., "log ingestion from GCC High")
- Identifying what service accounts support and their function
- Backup service accounts are a classic example - "accounts that are not people, but act like people"

**Shared System Accounts (when compliant):**
- Root/admin accounts managed via password vault (e.g., ERPM - Enterprise Random Password Manager)
- User checks out password, uses it, checks in, password auto-rotates
- Traceability maintained through the vault audit log

---

## Insufficient

No explicit "insufficient" scenarios were discussed in this channel.

---

## Over-engineering

**Windows Built-in Service Accounts:**
- Local Service, Network Service, System, TrustedInstaller
- Expert guidance: "Those are Windows processes. Just ignore those IMO"
- If documenting: "native Microsoft Windows accounts necessary for system function" is sufficient

**Locally Running User Applications:**
- Processes like Word, Outlook running under a user's context
- Clarification: "That's not a process acting on behalf of a user - that's a process being run as a user"
- These are NOT what 3.5.1[b] is asking for

---

## Edge Cases

**Distinction Between 3.1.1 and 3.5.1:**
- 3.1.1 = "identifying" authorized users for creating/managing accounts
- 3.5.1/3.5.2 = how IT systems identify (via username, device ID, UUID) and authenticate (authenticator, password, certificate) user accounts, service accounts/SPNs, or devices
- Same assessment objective wording but different applications

**Shared System Accounts:**
- Assessment guide states: "Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts"
- Shared accounts are acceptable IF traceability is maintained (e.g., via PAM/password vault checkout logs)
- Role accounts for automatic backups fall under "processes acting on behalf of users"

**Determining If You Have Service Accounts:**
- "Is it as simple as asking myself if we have created an account specifically for a certain service/app to run?" - Answer: "Basically."
- Check for: client/server connections, app/database connections, cloud integrations
- Service principals in cloud environments count as service accounts

---

## Evidence Examples

**For Device Identification:**
- InTune device inventory with device IDs and serial numbers
- NAC solution device registry
- MAC address inventory for non-managed devices
- Documented policy defining device identification method

**For Process/Service Account Identification:**
- List of service accounts with documented purposes (e.g., "log ingestion from GCC High")
- Password vault/PAM audit logs for shared privileged accounts
- Service principal inventory for cloud integrations

**For User Identification:**
- AD/Entra ID user directory
- User account provisioning records

## Key Quotes

**On the distinction between 3.1.1 and 3.5.1:**
> "3.1.1 and 3.5.1 AOs are identical in their wording (unhelpful), but they have different applications. 3.1.1 is 'identifying' authorized users for the purpose of creating and managing accounts for those users. 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 is all about how IT systems identify (via username, device ID, UUID) and authenticate (authenticator, password, certificate) user accounts, service accounts/SPNs, or devices."

**On defining "processes acting on behalf of users":**
> "I would define it in your documentation. I define it as those using service accounts."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On what service accounts are:**
> "Backups is a classic example... and honestly I think that is what they were going for. Accounts, that are not people, but act like people."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On user-run applications vs. service accounts:**
> "That's not a process acting on behalf of a user though - that's a process being run as a user"
> -- Jake (Fellow)

**On Windows built-in service accounts:**
> "Those are Windows processes. Just ignore those IMO"
> -- Jake (Fellow)

> "and if you feel the need to document them, that's how you describe them. native microsoft windows accounts necessary for system function. done."
> -- Uncouth, CCP (Fellow, Certified CMMC Professional)

**On device identifiers:**
> "It depends on how you identify those devices. For instance InTune will assign a device ID associated with the manufacturer's serial number, that would be a unique and non-reusable device ID (3.5.1 and 3.5.5). Devices which are not AD-joined/InTune managed require some other method whether that be NAC solution or MAC address, that is up to the organization to define in policy/procedure."
> -- CyberChad

**On compliant shared system accounts:**
> "root with a password managed by a password tool (ie Enterprise Random Password Manager - ERPM), people login to ERPM, 'check out' the root password, use it, then 'check in' the password, and the ERPM software goes and changes the root password (and can also spin the password on a regular basis). You still know who used the account to be able to trace it."
> -- elwing (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**Definition of identifier (from NIST glossary, cited in discussion):**
> "A unique label used by a system to indicate a specific entity, object, or group."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
