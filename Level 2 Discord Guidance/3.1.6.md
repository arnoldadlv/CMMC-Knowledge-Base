# 3.1.6 - Expertise Overlay
## Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.6[a] nonsecurity functions are identified
- 3.1.6[b] users are required to use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing nonsecurity functions

---

## Sufficient

### Policy + Training Implementation
- This control is "always a paper policy/training implementation" per rybo (Moderator/Fellow)
- Policy stating privileged users are not to use their privileged accounts for non-security functions is acceptable
- Policy should list what constitutes non-security functions and non-security data
- Training should reinforce behavioral expectations for administrators

### Defining Non-Security Functions
- Can be defined as "all functions which do not require privileged credentials"
- Can state "non-security functions are all functions which are not listed as security functions" - effectively everything not explicitly identified as a security function
- Assessor Spock67 (CCA): "Literally everything not identified as a security function"
- OSC has power to identify/define in a reasonable way they can explain to an assessor

### Role-Based Approaches
- Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is acceptable - assign users as "eligible" for admin permissions with approval workflow and time-limited activation
- sudo on Linux meets the requirement as long as users are not running everything as root - they ARE using non-privileged accounts up until the moment they run elevated functions
- PIM concept: "1 account, but limited privilege elevation isolated to a single session/task"

### Evidence Approaches for 3.1.6[b]
- Test of non-privileged function trying to execute privileged function
- Logs showing denies
- GPO settings showing prevention
- Policy and procedure documentation
- Administrator interviews

---

## Insufficient

### Single Account with Permanent Admin Rights
- Local user accounts with admin access used for both elevated and non-privileged roles are non-compliant
- Account alias that does day-to-day work with administrative permission is noncompliant
- If a user is assigned as group admin with user admin features AND uses same account for normal Office suite features without role separation = noncompliant

### Best Practice Without Documentation
- "Best practice" alone is not sufficient - must be documented in policy/procedures and training
- Defined behavior must be written, not just assumed

### Sudo Without Restrictions
- Having root access through sudo does not inherently restrict permissions
- Must be prepared to address 3.1.5, 3.1.6, AND 3.1.7 together when using sudo
- Focus on describing how organization restricts permissions, not just that sudo exists

---

## Over-engineering

### Separate Accounts for All CSP Admin Roles
- PreVeil admin accounts may not require separate non-privileged accounts
- Assessor Spock67 (CCA) on separate PreVeil admin license: "I don't think that would be required"
- Earlier discussion noted PreVeil limitation of no "free, unlicensed" admin account, implying this is a known challenge without clear requirement

### Developer Local Admin Separation
- Based on 3.1.5 discussion language, local admin for devs may be defensible as not privileged if they cannot affect security functions
- "The power of definition is huge. Use it wisely. You can write your definition so that local admins for devs are not treated as privileged. They need them to do their work which are non-security functions." - Spock67 (CCA)

---

## Edge Cases

### Linux/Ubuntu Sudo Users
- Users with sudo group membership: "they ARE using a non-privileged account or role up until the moment they run a function elevated using sudo"
- As long as they are not running everything sudo/root (like running Chromium as root), they are fine
- Can limit sudo access to specific commands (e.g., restarting services but not installing software) via sudoers configuration
- Role-based training can specify what sudo should/should not be used for

### Security Functions vs Privileged Functions (Interplay with 3.1.5 and 3.1.7)
- 3.1.5 = security functions
- 3.1.6 = non-security functions
- 3.1.7 = privileged functions
- Privileged functions can be identified as a subset of security functions - "not all security functions are considered privileged functions"
- NIST defines security functions; OSC identifies which components provide them
- "The flexibility comes from how the organization implements security controls not what is a security function" - Alabaster

### Define vs Identify Distinction
- NIST defines security functions as "hardware, software or firmware components responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data"
- OSC identifies (not defines) which components meet that definition in their environment
- Assessor reviews whether identification is correct and complete

---

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence
- Policy documenting that privileged users must not use privileged accounts for non-security functions
- List/table identifying security functions (everything else is by definition non-security)
- Training materials covering role-based expectations
- PIM configuration showing eligible roles with approval requirements
- GPO settings preventing non-privileged users from executing security functions (supports this control via 3.1.7)
- Sudoers configuration limiting commands users can execute with elevation

### What DIBCAC May Look For
- Screen share demonstrating separation (per DIBCAC assessment tool)
- Intent is to ensure separation of non-privileged and privileged functions
- Assessors validate adherence through policy/procedure review, admin interviews, and technical control testing

## Key Quotes

> "Blocking priv functions meets 3.1.7. This requirement (3.1.6) is, in my experience, always a paper policy/training implementation." - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "Basically, 'don't check your email while logged into a domain controller as DA.'" - rybo

> "If the account alias that does day to day work has administrative permission, then it's noncompliant." - Blt

> "The power of definition is huge. Use it wisely." - Spock67 (CCA)

> "Literally everything not identified as a security function." - Spock67 (CCA) on defining non-security functions

> "they ARE using a non-privileged account *or role* up until the moment they run a function elevated using sudo" - Uncouth (CCP)

> "so as long as they're not running *everything* sudo/root, like chromium, they're fine" - Uncouth (CCP)

> "very similar to PIM in the Entra world. 1 account, but limited privilege elevation isolated to a single session / task" - Uncouth (CCP)

> "the heart of this requirement is that you're not a privileged user (or using a privileged account) when doing nonprivileged things. Don't send email with a privileged account (sudo pine). Don't use privilege if you don't need to (sudo touch ~/myfile)" - Uncouth (CCP)

> "Remember these requirements don't live alone. What you have defined in 3.4 as least functionality aligns with how you answer 3.1.6" - Alabaster

> "Relying on sudo alone does not fully fulfill the NIST 171 r2 requirements. Systems are assessed as a whole, not in parts. In this case, I would be prepared to address questions related to controls 3.1.5, 3.1.6, and 3.1.7." - Alabaster

> "I hate this particular set of circular definitions but it is what it is." - Spock67 (CCA)

## Related Controls Discussion
- **3.1.5** - Security functions identified (defines what IS a security function)
- **3.1.7** - Privileged functions defined and non-privileged users prevented from executing them
- **3.4** - Least functionality aligns with 3.1.6 implementation
- Controls play together; none exist in a vacuum
