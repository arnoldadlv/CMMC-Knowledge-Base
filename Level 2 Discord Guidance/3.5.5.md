# 3.5.5 - Expertise Overlay
## Prevent reuse of identifiers for a defined period.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.5.5[a] a period within which identifiers cannot be reused is defined.
- 3.5.5[b] reuse of identifiers is prevented within the defined period.

---

## Sufficient

**Common acceptable approaches discussed:**
- Set an arbitrary time period (often two years) before an identifier (username, email) can be reused
- Put user accounts into a Disabled Users OU in Active Directory and never delete them
- For returning employees (same person, same identifier): Allow identifier reuse for the same individual by documenting this exception in policy/procedures and SSP

**Key guidance from NIST:** "Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or device identifiers to **different** individuals, groups, roles, or devices."

**M365/cloud-only environments:** For environments without on-premises AD, this is "one you'll just have to policy away" - document the defined period in policy and follow procedures.

## Insufficient

No specific insufficient implementations were discussed in this channel.

## Over-engineering

**Separating username from email address (IA-4(1) guidance from NIST HB 162):**
- Rybo (Moderator/Fellow): "IA-4(1) isn't part of the core DNA of 3.5.5" - this security enhancement was not incorporated into 800-171
- Jake (Fellow): "IA-4(1) isn't a part of any of the low/mod/high baselines, so it doesn't look like NIST actually expects anyone to do it"
- Rybo called it "A vestigial security control with no known purpose"
- Mike "The Compliance Guy" (Fellow): "I've always thought prohibiting public identifiers was a bit over the top given security through obscurity...most credentials are compromised via social engineering or darknet dumps"
- Rybo: "Chances are your adapted UPNs would also have a naming convention and predictable pattern. You're one leaked credential away from someone being able to reverse engineer other UPNs. It seems like diminishing returns."

**Separating UPN from email in M365:** Microsoft's own best practice is to keep SMTP and UPN identifiers the same.

## Edge Cases

**Same person returning (e.g., rehired intern):**
- Scenario: 2-year reuse prevention period, intern leaves, returns 8-9 months later
- Suggested solution: Allow identifier reuse for the same individual/group/role in your policy/procedures, document it in your SSP, and follow your policy/procedures
- NIST guidance supports this: preventing reuse means preventing assignment to "**different**" individuals
- Liatris (Certified CMMC Assessor, C3PAO): "I agree with your suggestion to write it into the policy"

**Device identifiers:**
- Question raised about how to handle device identifier reuse
- NIST definition focuses on "person's identity" which creates ambiguity
- CNSSI-1253 specifies "Not appropriate to define for device identifiers" for preventing reuse
- JB: "In 171 the language of the glossary definition in the standard itself could be considered a higher authority than its 53 parent control"

**Data retention concerns:**
- Hoo (Fellow/Assessor/AOS-G): "Lawyers twitching everywhere from the idea of holding onto users data indefinitely"

---

## Evidence Examples

**Documentation needed:**
- Defined time period for identifier reuse prevention (commonly 2 years)
- Policy/procedure documenting identifier management
- SSP documentation of approach
- For AD environments: Screenshot/evidence of Disabled Users OU
- For cloud-only: Policy documentation of the defined period

No discussion found regarding specific evidence artifacts that were accepted or rejected during assessments.

## Key Quotes

**On the actual control requirement:**
> "Most organizations I know either set an arbitrary time period (often two years) before an identifier (username, email) can be reused, or they simply put user accounts into a Disabled Users OU in Active Directory and never delete them." - Rybo (Moderator/Fellow/MEP)

**On IA-4(1) / username obfuscation not being required:**
> "This is good advice. However, in classic HB 162 fashion I have no idea how it applies here. The 800-53 control that governs usernames (IA-4) has a security enhancement specifically for this recommended practice, but it wasn't incorporated into 800-171." - Rybo

> "This is all advisory not compulsory under 171/CMMC. Great thing for real security. Not required currently for compliant security." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On same-person identifier reuse:**
> "Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or device identifiers to **different** individuals, groups, roles, or devices." - NIST IA-4/3.5.5 guidance (quoted in discussion)

**On device identifiers:**
> "CNSSI-1253 specifies 'Not appropriate to define for device identifiers' for preventing reuse and disabling inactive, so it's probably fair to assume we can take the same liberty." - JB

**On M365-only environments:**
> "365 only, this is one you'll just have to policy away" - Hoo (Fellow/Assessor)
