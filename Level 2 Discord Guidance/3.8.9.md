# 3.8.9 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at storage locations.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- Verify that the confidentiality of backup CUI is protected at storage locations (per NIST 800-171A)

---

## Sufficient

- **FedRAMP/FedRAMP Moderate Equivalent cloud storage for backups**: Using OneDrive/SharePoint in GCC or GCC-High tenant satisfies this control. (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **Inheriting from cloud provider**: If all CUI storage and backups are handled by a FedRAMP-authorized cloud provider (e.g., Microsoft GCC-H, Box with appropriate authorization), the control can be fully inherited. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA/Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **Physical + logical security combination for on-prem (Rev 2)**: NAS with CUI in a locked server room with physical access control plus key, where users access via logically secured environment with proper authentication, logging, and monitoring, and endpoints use FIPS 140-2 encryption - this is acceptable under Rev 2. (MonkSecurity - CCP)
- **Cloud-only architecture**: "This would work extremely well in an assessment if this is your only form of backup." - regarding storing all work and CUI in native Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint solutions where backups are controlled by Microsoft in GCC-H. (socketsetter, Certified CMMC Assessor)

---

## Insufficient

- **Claiming 100% inheritance without proper scoping**: "If you want to say 'We use GCCH and inherit all controls. Everything is in the cloud.' Then no that will not work." - Must still demonstrate understanding and proper implementation. (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **Missing FedRAMP requirement**: FedRAMP or FedRAMP Moderate equivalent is required for cloud backup storage regardless of encryption status per latest DoD position. (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **CUI in unaccounted locations**: If you claim cloud inheritance but have CUI stored elsewhere that you haven't accounted for, the control is not satisfied. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)

---

## Over-engineering

- **FIPS 140-2 encryption on NAS with existing physical/logical controls (Rev 2)**: Under Rev 2, if the NAS is in a physically secured server room with proper physical access controls and users access via FIPS 140-2 encrypted endpoints with proper authentication/logging/monitoring, additional FIPS encryption on the NAS itself may not be required. Note: This may change in Rev 3. (MonkSecurity - CCP)

---

## Edge Cases

- **Box as primary CUI storage**: If organization's only CUI is in Box and they do not download local copies, they can inherit this control from Box - but must verify CUI is not stored anywhere else. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- **Microsoft 365 Backup limitations in GCC-H**: Native Microsoft 365 Backup may not be supported in GCC/GCC-High environments. Organizations should verify availability and may need to consult GCC-High specific resources. (Community discussion)
- **Rev 2 vs Rev 3 considerations**: Requirements around on-premises encryption (desktops, storage) may be changing from Rev 2 to Rev 3. Verify current requirements. (MonkSecurity - CCP)

---

## Evidence Examples

- **Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM)** from cloud service provider (Box, Microsoft, etc.) documenting backup protections - "You have their CRM, yes? It should say they do this for you." (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- FedRAMP authorization documentation for backup storage provider
- Policy/procedure stating backup locations and protection mechanisms
- SSP documentation showing inheritance from authorized CSP
- For on-prem: Physical security documentation, access logs, encryption verification

## Key Quotes

> "If you are using OneDrive that is in a GCC or GCCH tenant then I would take that for this. Realize that FedRAMP or FedRAMP moderate equivalent is required for this control regardless of the encryption status of the CUI per the latest DoD position."
> -- **Spock67** (Certified CMMC Assessor, CCP, Technology Vendor)

> "How broadly are you looking to satisfy assessors? For this particular control? [...] Now if you want to say 'We use GCCH and inherit all controls. Everything is in the cloud.' Then no that will not work."
> -- **Spock67** (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "They could 100% inherit this one control if all is in GCC/H and they don't do other backups on their own. Right?" ... "Exactly"
> -- **Glenda R. Snodgrass** (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow) confirmed by **Spock67** (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "This would work extremely well in an assessment if this is your only form of backup."
> -- **socketsetter** (Certified CMMC Assessor) - regarding GCC-H OneDrive/SharePoint with Microsoft-controlled backups

> "If you are sure you don't have CUI anywhere else, then yes."
> -- **Glenda R. Snodgrass** (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor) - on inheriting from cloud provider

> "You would inherit this control from Box."
> -- **Glenda R. Snodgrass** (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "You have their CRM, yes? It should say they do this for you."
> -- **Glenda R. Snodgrass** (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor) - on evidence from CSP

> "Rev 2 you are OK. I haven't re-read draft Rev 3 in a couple of months, but I seem to remember that was being considered (or it might just have been on-prem desktops), I don't remember."
> -- **MonkSecurity - CCP** (Established Member) - regarding physical security sufficiency for NAS without FIPS encryption
