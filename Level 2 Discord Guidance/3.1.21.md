# 3.1.21 - Expertise Overlay
## Control Statement
Limit use of portable storage devices on external systems.

## Assessment Objectives (from rybo)
- 3.1.21[a] the use of portable storage devices containing CUI on external systems is identified and documented.
- 3.1.21[b] limits on the use of portable storage devices containing CUI on external systems are defined.
- 3.1.21[c] the use of portable storage devices containing CUI on external systems is limited as defined.

---

## Sufficient
- **Policy + Training**: Amira Armond (C3PAO, Fellow) confirmed that "Training is standard" when asked how to limit use without technical controls. Policy and guidelines documenting what users can and cannot do with CUI, combined with training, is accepted.
- **Administrative controls**: Policy prohibiting use of company CUI removable drives on external systems (e.g., hotel kiosks, personal computers) with user training.
- **Check-out/check-in process**: Documented process for media that needs to be checked-out/in prior to leaving the controlled environment, handled only by authorized users.

## Insufficient
- **Encryption alone does not satisfy this control**: Kenneth Ingham (CCA) clarified that encryption software (like Endpoint Protector) "does not prevent an employee from pushing CUI to an encrypted external storage device and working on it on their personal computer." Encryption protects data but doesn't limit WHERE the device can be used.
- **USB control software on YOUR systems**: Dale From CurrentWare correctly noted that USB control software (AccessPatrol, ManageEngine, etc.) only works on systems where the client software is installed - it provides no protection on external systems where there is no agent.

## Over-engineering
No discussion found.

## Edge Cases
- **Definition of "external"**: fluffyneenja clarified that "'external' doesn't just mean outside of your enterprise or 'not controlled by company', but it can also mean external to your CUI siloed environment within your enterprise." This broadens the scope to include non-CUI systems within the organization.
- **Whose media?**: Amira Armond raised an interesting point: "The practice statement doesn't say *your* media." This suggests the control may apply to preventing use of ANY external media, not just organization-owned media.
- **Technical controls on external systems are impossible for BYOD**: Personal devices and truly external systems cannot have technical controls enforced since there's no client software present.

## Evidence Examples
- Policy defining which users are authorized to take media to work on external systems
- Documentation of approved portable storage devices
- Documentation of approved external systems (if any)
- Training records showing users understand portable storage device restrictions
- Check-out/check-in logs for portable media (if applicable)
- Guidelines documenting what users can and cannot do with CUI on external systems

## Technical Control Options (discussed but not required)
- **IronKey with Enterprise Management Service (EMS)**: Allows system-binding to designate what systems the USB device can connect to
- **BitLocker + GPO**: On-prem solution enforcing BitLocker encrypted USB drives unlock only on domain-joined systems
- **Certificate-based authentication**: System carries certificate that matches the USB device

Note: These technical controls exist but are NOT REQUIRED. Training and policy are accepted as sufficient.

> "Training is standard" - Amira Armond (C3PAO, Fellow), when asked how to limit use without technical controls

> "Basically don't plug your company CUI removable drive in the kiosk at the hotel..." - 22billthecat (endorsed by Amira with "this" reaction)

> "The practice statement doesn't say *your* media." - Amira Armond, noting the control may apply broadly

> "'External Systems' is the main driver and the removable media being a controlled item that needs to be checked-out/in prior to leaving the controlled environment AND only handled by an authorized user." - G3Zero

> "I don't have a technical control that prevents someone from plugging in their encrypted USB into another device." - RWeReady (question that led to confirmation training is sufficient)

> "[Encryption software] does not prevent an employee from pushing CUI to an encrypted external storage device and working on it on their personal computer... nothing technical is stopping it." - Kenneth Ingham (CCA)

> "CMMC (government) controls are not written to fully prevent an authorized user from performing malicious or insider threat tasks." - fluffyneenja

> "'external' doesn't just mean outside of your enterprise or 'not controlled by company', but it can also mean external to your CUI siloed environment within your enterprise." - fluffyneenja
