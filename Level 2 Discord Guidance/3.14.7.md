# 3.14.7 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Identify unauthorized use of organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.14.7[a] authorized use of the system is defined.
- 3.14.7[b] unauthorized use of the system is identified.

---

## Sufficient

- **AO [a]:** Policy defining what authorized use is (e.g., Acceptable Use Policy)
- **AO [b]:** Demonstrate how you detect unauthorized use - but NOT required to have a technical detection for every AUP item
- For non-technical AUP items (like "don't take pictures of CUI with your phone"): Policy + training documenting the prohibition is sufficient evidence
- For technical items: Show the detection mechanism (e.g., device authentication preventing unauthorized VPN access + monitoring logs)
- Screenshot showing only authorized applications installed (demonstrating unauthorized apps are not present)

---

## Insufficient

No explicit discussion of insufficient implementations found.

---

## Over-engineering

**Explicitly called out as over-engineering:**
- Implementing technical detection for every single AUP item
- Requiring technical controls to identify violations like "taking pictures of CUI with phone"

**Key clarification from LebowskiDude:**
> "Do we need to show how we identify unauthorized use by having a technical configuration for every point made in the AUP? -- NO"
>
> "For example the AUP has a list of 10 things. Then do we need to show how we identify unauthorized use for each of those 10 points? -- NO"

---

## Edge Cases

**Physical/non-technical AUP violations:**
- Question: "Some of the points in our AUP are like 'don't take pictures of CUI with your phone'. So how can you identify that type of unauthorized use?"
- Answer: Policy + training that says people are not allowed to take pictures is the evidence. Also: "Did anyone report anyone doing it?"

**Philosophical point raised:**
> "How can you show that something is not happening when you are not looking? You can't"

This acknowledges that not all unauthorized use can be technically detected - that's acceptable.

## Evidence Examples

**Example 1 - Technical (authorized application use):**
- Policy: Authorized use of a computer - running AutoCAD
- Unauthorized use: running other apps besides AutoCAD
- Evidence: Policy + screenshot of AutoCAD installed on the computer and no other third party apps in Installed Apps

**Example 2 - Non-technical (photo prohibition):**
- Policy: People are not allowed to take pictures of work computer screen
- Evidence: Policy + training that says people are not allowed to take pictures of the work computer screen

**Example 3 - Device authentication:**
- AUP item: Don't use unauthorized devices for VPN access
- Evidence: Device authentication tool allowing only authorized devices + VPN access point monitoring

## Key Quotes

**Uncouth, CCP (Certified CMMC Professional, Fellow):**
> "define what authorized use is, and then show how you detect any unauthorized use"

**LebowskiDude:**
> "Do we need to show how we identify unauthorized use by having a technical configuration for every point made in the AUP? -- NO"

> "Does AO b need to address each of authorized use statements identified in AO a? -- No"

> "How can you show that something is not happening when you are not looking? You can't"
