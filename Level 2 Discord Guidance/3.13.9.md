# 3.13.9 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Terminate network connections associated with communications sessions at the end of the sessions or after a defined period of inactivity.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.13.9[a] a period of inactivity to terminate network connections associated with communications sessions is defined.
- 3.13.9[b] network connections associated with communications sessions are terminated at the end of the sessions.
- 3.13.9[c] network connections associated with communications sessions are terminated after the defined period of inactivity.

## Sufficient

- **Firewall idle connection timeout settings** (TCP/UDP connection timeout) are "a very normal way to meet this requirement" - Amira Armond (C3PAO)
- **Default tcp/udp connection timeout** on firewall is acceptable (same as "idle connection timeout" - just different vendor terminology)
- **VPN session termination** is an acceptable implementation for remote access scenarios
- **Corporate firewall session-ttl** (e.g., 1 hour) qualifies as a valid implementation
- **AO [b] and [c] can be satisfied with either/or approach** - In 800-53 these are a single assessment objective joined by "or". Same with 171r3. The separation in 171r2 is viewed as a "faux pas"
- **Policy defining which network sessions require termination** combined with user instructions to log out or close browser sessions

## Insufficient

- No explicit examples of insufficient implementations were discussed in this channel.

## Over-engineering

- **Automatic daily session termination for user sessions (AC control 3.1.11)** - Amira Armond noted this is "extra" and unnecessary. The AC control can be met simply with "the log off command closes the user session automatically"
- **Setting up periodic pings to keep VPN alive** (suggested as workaround for 15-minute DoD ODP) - may defeat the security purpose of the control

## Edge Cases

### Laptops Leaving the Organization (WFH Scenarios)
- **Question:** If laptops leave the corporate network, the boundary changes to the device. How to set session-ttl at device level?
- **Expert Response (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor):** "I dont define that as a session that requires termination. We use our VPN session termination."
- **Alternative Suggestion:** Always-on VPN so all traffic tunnels through the firewall, ensuring all firewall configuration/rules apply to WFH laptops

### Distinction from User Session Termination (3.1.11)
- **This control (3.13.9) is NETWORK session termination** - focuses on TCP/UDP connections, firewall session management
- **AC.L2-3.1.11 is USER session termination** - focuses on user logoff, session lock
- **Important Clarification from Amira Armond:** "For 1 you don't need an automatic trigger [for AC control]. The session must end automatically when the trigger occurs. But the trigger itself can be manual. Such as clicking log off."

### DoD ODP Timeout Value
- **The DoD ODP for this is 15 minutes** which is described as "insane" for VPN usage
- Organizations have configured 24-hour disconnect regardless of inactivity as an alternative approach

### Browser and Application Socket Behavior
- **[b] addresses userland software** - sockets should be closed when apps/tabs are closed
- **[c] addresses OS services/kernel** - configured as catch-all to time out inactive sockets
- **Browsers are notoriously bad** at leaving dangling sockets - worth investigating alternatives even if you can pass assessment

## Evidence Examples

- **Screenshot of VPN settings** showing timeout configuration - "A screenshot of VPN settings might work fine"
- **Firewall configuration** showing TCP/UDP connection timeout settings
- **Policy documentation** defining which network sessions require termination and user responsibilities

### Suggested Evidence for AO [b] (Session End)
- Question raised about netstat before/after Exchange Online session, or VPN connect/disconnect with shared folder access test
- No definitive answer provided, but VPN settings screenshot was confirmed as acceptable

## Key Quotes

> "I'm assuming you are referring to the 'idle connection timeout' setting in your firewall? That is a very normal way to meet this requirement" - Amira Armond (C3PAO, Kieri Solutions)

> "Yeah... The additional content in the assessment guide occasionally misunderstands the requirements. It was written in a rush.." - Amira Armond (on assessment guide suggesting day/time termination)

> "In 800-53 these are a single assessment objective joined by 'or'. Same with 171r3. I view this as a 171r2 faux pas but if you're concerned, it could be a good thing to bring up pre-assessment to make sure your C3PAO/CCA's are on the same page as you." - JB (on AO [b] vs [c] being OR condition)

> "[b] - userland software should be written such that sockets are closed when they are no longer needed (e.g. when you close the app/tab). [c] - the os services and/or kernel are configured as a catch-all to time out inactive sockets after a defined period, including a failure associated with [b]." - JB (technical clarification)

> "Although not explicitly called for I think there is room here for you to define what network sessions require termination." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Now if your log off doesn't work because the back end programmer sucks, then you will fail it. But it takes some effort to mess up that badly" - Amira Armond (on AC control, not this SC control)

> "the DoD ODP for this is 15 minutes, which is insane. Our users would revolt if they had to login to the VPN anytime they were inactive for 15 minutes." - Cuipacabra, CCP
