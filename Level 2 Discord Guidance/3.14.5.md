# 3.14.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Perform periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.14.5[a] the frequency for malicious code scans is defined.
- 3.14.5[b] malicious code scans are performed with the defined frequency.
- 3.14.5[c] real-time malicious code scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed are performed.

## Sufficient

- **Weekly scheduled scans** passed DIBCAC assessment (Jake: "For our DIBCAC, we had it set to do weekly scans")
- **Real-time scanning at ingress points** (email scanning on arrival) can satisfy [c] without needing on-access scanning (Jake: "I scan my email as it comes in - so no need to scan on access")
- **Quick scans** are acceptable when combined with real-time scanning - the requirement doesn't specify Full vs Quick scans (Uncouth: "since the requirement doesn't specifically state, just say what you do, and do what you say. if you think a Quick Scan is sufficient, then do that")
- **Gateway/Firewall AV with DPI** can potentially satisfy [c] for Linux systems if all downloads must traverse the firewall (Glenda, Lead CCA: "I think that could pass if the servers can only download files via the firewall")
- **Scans at designated locations only** - not necessarily on all in-scope systems (Jeff Baldwin, CCA: "I interpret as requiring scans on the locations specified only")
- **EDR with real-time scanning** covering transit, access, and execution can reduce need for intensive periodic scans
- **Vendor documentation** showing real-time approach is equivalent to periodic scanning can support alternative implementations (Uncouth: "best bet for an EDR that does not do periodic scans is to find some documentation from the vendor that expresses why their approach is at least as good as a periodic scan")

## Insufficient

- **Real-time scanning only** without any periodic scans - The control contains TWO independent requirements: (1) periodic scans AND (2) real-time scans. Assessment objectives [a] and [b] require defined frequency and execution of periodic scans. (W Paul Hardin: "there doesn't appear to be enough flexibility in the requirement to permit **only** doing 'real-time' scans")
- **Mobile devices (iOS/Android) with only web protection** - MDE on iOS only offers web protection, which is not sufficient for real-time file scanning. However, see Edge Cases for mobile device handling.
- **Linux systems in FIPS mode using incompatible AV** - ClamAV was historically incompatible with FIPS mode (being fixed in beta versions)
- **Gateway AV with coverage gaps** - If downloads can bypass the firewall through other devices/relays, DPI/AV solution has a gap (Glenda: "If downloads could also happen through some other device/relay, you have a gap")

## Over-engineering

- **Full scans on systems with comprehensive real-time protection** - When EDR provides real-time scanning in transit, on access, and on execution, full scans add significant load with minimal additional security value (CoDeRs: "With those features in place the added load on a Full scan just seems to be counter productive")
- **Scanning files on "opened"** - This is part of an OR statement; assessors focus on downloads and execution. Opening read-only files without execution is not a primary concern (rybo: "Thankfully, it's an 'or' statement, and assessors are focused on downloads and execution. I'm not sure how opening a read-only file (with no file execution) would allow malware to malware")
- **Full scans on hundreds of TB repositories** - Interval scans become impractical at scale (IT Roadkill: "what's the point...when we have hundreds of TB of data in a single repository and it would take a million years to pretend to scan it")

## Edge Cases

### Mobile Devices (iOS/Android)
- **Mobile devices accessing CUI email are NOT required to have traditional AV scanning** per DoD CIO guidance
- Mobile requirements: EMM enrollment, app containerization, patch management, jailbreak detection, and logging
- Solution: Intune/MAM with device compliance policies satisfies mobile requirements
- (rybo: "I don't apply it to phones accessing CUI, since DoD CIO only requires EMM enrollment, app containerization, patch management, jailbreak detection, and logging")

### Linux Systems in FIPS Mode
- ClamAV historically incompatible with FIPS mode - now being fixed in beta
- Alternative approach: DPI + Gateway AV if all traffic traverses firewall
- Critical gap: If any download path bypasses firewall, solution fails

### HPC/SAN Environments
- Using a "jump box" as the designated location can potentially avoid scan overhead on HPC/SAN
- Interpretation: "periodic scans at designated locations" may be acceptable
- Requires defining and documenting the designated locations in policy

### EDR Solutions Without Periodic Scan Feature
- Some modern EDR solutions don't have a periodic scan mechanism
- Solution: Obtain vendor documentation explaining how their approach provides equivalent coverage
- Document in SSP that continuous real-time scanning covers all file access

## Evidence Examples

- **Policy documentation** defining scan frequency (satisfies [a])
- **AV/EDR configuration screenshots** showing scheduled scan settings
- **Scan logs/reports** demonstrating scans occur at defined frequency (satisfies [b])
- **Real-time protection settings** showing scanning on download/execute (satisfies [c])
- **Email security configuration** showing inbound email scanning
- **Mobile device management (Intune/MAM) compliance policies** for mobile devices
- **Vendor documentation** for EDR equivalency arguments
- **Network diagrams** showing all traffic routes through firewall AV (for gateway-based solutions)
