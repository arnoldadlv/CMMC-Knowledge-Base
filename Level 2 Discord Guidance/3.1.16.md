# 3.1.16 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.16[a] wireless access points are identified.
- 3.1.16[b] wireless access is authorized prior to allowing such connections.

---

## Sufficient

- **WPA2-PSK is acceptable** - Assessors confirm WPA2-PSK provides sufficient authentication and encryption. Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow): "It features authentication and encryption. That's all an assessor cares about."

- **WPA3 with preshared keys distributed through Intune** - Mentioned as an implementation approach where users don't know the password.

- **FIPS VPN + TLS 1.2 for remote access** - When laptops connect to external wireless (e.g., hotel WiFi) and use FIPS-validated VPN to access company resources, this is compliant.

- **IT pre-configuring wireless credentials during device build** - Having IT join devices to wireless during setup so end users don't need to know the password, combined with prohibiting personal devices on internal network, is considered compliant.

- **GCC High with TLS encryption** - When using cloud services with TLS encryption, wireless becomes just a transport layer.

## Insufficient

No discussion found of specific implementations marked as insufficient or failing.

## Over-engineering

- **802.1X for this control** - rybo advises that while 802.1x is great, "that's a better fit to help you meet 3.5.2" (identification and authentication). WPA2-PSK is sufficient for 3.1.16.

- **Creating separate RSN (Robust Security Network) per NIST 800-97** - User proposed this approach but was advised WPA2-PSK is sufficient.

## Edge Cases

### Remote/Mobile Workers Using External Wireless

**Scenario:** Company has disabled wireless on office network, but user laptops can still connect to external wireless (hotel, etc.) for remote work.

**Resolution:** If traffic is encrypted (TLS to GCC High, FIPS VPN), the external wireless is not a CUI asset and the control is met. Per MonkSecurity: "If it is encrypted, wireless isn't CUI asset. TLS to GCC high is encrypted. FIPS VPN is encrypted."

### Wireless as Transport Only (N/A Scenario)

**Scenario:** Using Exostar or PreVeil where CUI stays within those systems using TLS FIPS validated ciphers.

**Resolution:** If wireless is not a CUI asset because you are FIPS encrypting through it as just transport, then 3.1.16 (and 3.1.17) are N/A. Per CyberAscend: "If the wireless is not going to be a CUI asset, meaning that you are FIPS encrypting through it as just a transport, then yes, I would say 3.1.16/17 are N/A."

### Shared WiFi Password Concerns

**Scenario:** WiFi password written on whiteboard in conference room accessible to guests.

**Discussion:** User concerned this would fail assessment despite having separate guest SSID. Assessor response indicated WPA2-PSK still acceptable from compliance standpoint, though user acknowledged it was "kinda laughable" from a security perspective.

## Evidence Examples

- Policy stating company network will not allow wireless access and wireless is disabled by technical configuration
- FIPS VPN configuration for remote access
- TLS 1.2 enforcement on all devices
- Intune configuration distributing preshared keys (WPA3)
- IT procedures for pre-configuring wireless credentials during device provisioning
- Separate guest network with no internal connections

## Key Quotes

> "Wireless is only needed if you are marking it a CUI asset (it connects to your on-prem resources). If your laptop is using typical firewall settings as a boundary and you aren't sending un-encrypted CUI over the air, these are met."
> - MonkSecurity (CCP)

> "If it is encrypted, wireless isn't CUI asset. TLS to GCC high is encrypted. FIPS VPN is encrypted."
> - MonkSecurity (CCP)

> "You'll be fine with WPA2-PSK. Trust."
> - rybo (Moderator/Fellow/MEP)

> "It features authentication and encryption. That's all an assessor cares about. We use WPA3 and preshared keys distributed through Intune, so users don't know the password. 802.1x is great, but that's a better fit to help you meet 3.5.2."
