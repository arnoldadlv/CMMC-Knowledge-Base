# 3.1.14 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Route remote access via managed access control points.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.14[a] managed access control points are identified and implemented.
- 3.1.14[b] remote access is routed through managed network access control points.

---

## Sufficient

### Cloud-Only / SaaS Environments
- **Azure AD / Entra ID Conditional Access** serves as a managed access control point for M365 GCC-High environments (confirmed by medicooey - Certified CMMC Assessor, C3PAO, passed DIBCAC)
- For cloud-only organizations, cloud provider access control mechanisms (like Azure AD Conditional Access) can satisfy the requirement even if you argue the control technically doesn't apply
- Network diagram showing access control points is helpful but not strictly required for cloud-only environments

### TIC 3.0 Characteristics for Managed Access Control Points (per rybo - Moderator, Fellow, MEP)
- Holistic TLS/SSL inspection
- Policy enforcement point that enforces network access policies and logs connection transactions
- Integration with central log management tool or service
- Integration with approved identity provider(s)
- Anti-malware protection
- Intrusion detection

### Hybrid Environments
- VPN at firewall for users accessing network
- Conditional Access from network to GCC-High resources

---

## Insufficient

No discussion found of specific examples that were deemed insufficient.

---

## Over-engineering

No explicit over-engineering examples discussed. However, the discussions imply that requiring VPN for cloud-only environments may be unnecessary when cloud-native access controls exist.

## Edge Cases

### Cloud Resources / SaaS - Is It Even Remote Access?
**Key Debate:** Whether accessing cloud resources like M365 GCC-High constitutes "remote access" under 800-171.

**Position 1 (medicooey - Certified CMMC Assessor, C3PAO):**
- "We've successfully argued that accessing your own cloud resources is generally not remote access"
- 800-171 defines remote access as access to an "organizational system" - M365 GCC-High could be argued as an external cloud system covered under FedRAMP per DFARS 7012, not an organizational system
- "this control wasn't written with SaaS in mind"
- "everyone in the room [DIBCAC] recognized, rightly, that this control wasn't written with SaaS in mind"
- Original intent was "legacy on-prem infrastructure being remotely accessed and forcing people to use a VPN or similar"

**Position 2 (lombo617 - Certified CMMC Professional):**
- All M365 GCC-High access is over internet, which NIST explicitly mentions as "external system"
- Cloud systems like GCC-High could be considered both organizational systems AND external CSP since both entities have shared responsibilities

**Practical Resolution:**
- Even if applicability is debated, demonstrate compliance anyway using cloud access controls (Azure AD Conditional Access)
- Strategy: "well we aren't even sure this control applies to M365 since that's an external system covered by FedRAMP, and has secured TLS 1.2 tunnels to everything - but hey, if it is in scope we meet the requirement anyway"

### MSP Remote Management of Endpoints
**Question:** Does an MSP need VPN to remotely manage user laptops for a fully remote organization?

**Answer (ace_rimmer - Fellow):**
- No VPN required
- "This wouldn't really be applicable to this control, since it's not remote control to your information system - it's remote control of specific individual systems"
- Distinction: remote access TO organizational information system vs. remote management OF individual endpoints

### External Collaboration via SharePoint
**Question raised but NOT answered:** How to handle managed access control points when external users from other companies access SharePoint sites for collaboration/file sharing in GCC-High.

- Partial inheritance from FedRAMP noted in CRM: "Government customers are responsible for routing remote access traffic to M365 through a limited number of managed access points"
- Comparison made to SaaS file sharing - typically no managed access control point for website-style access
- **Status: Open question without resolution in thread**

### Specific Tools - Unanswered
The following were asked but NOT answered in the thread:
- TeamViewer - is it a "remote access point"?
- Quick Assist
- AWS GovCloud access control mechanisms

---

## Evidence Examples

### Recommended Evidence Sources
1. **Network diagram** - showing managed access control points (thumbs-up from Amira Armond - Fellow, C3PAO)
2. **Azure AD / Entra ID Conditional Access policies** - for cloud environments
3. **VPN/Firewall configuration** - for on-prem or hybrid with traditional infrastructure

### SSP Approach (from medicooey's DIBCAC experience)
- Focus on Azure AD as the control point for cloud-only environments
- Address potential scoping ambiguity directly: acknowledge uncertainty about applicability while demonstrating compliance anyway
