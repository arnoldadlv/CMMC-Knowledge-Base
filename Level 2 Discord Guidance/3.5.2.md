# 3.5.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Authenticate (or verify) the identities of users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.5.2[a] the identity of each user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access.
- 3.5.2[b] the identity of each process acting on behalf of a user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access.
- 3.5.2[c] the identity of each device accessing or connecting to the system is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access.

## Sufficient

### Device Authentication for Small Organizations
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow), the control says "authenticated **or verified**":
- A small organization could physically inventory devices with a known, fixed location (in a controlled area) and in doing so wouldn't need to perform device authentication
- For remote devices, some form of device authentication is probably appropriate
- If all remote devices are domain joined or MDM enrolled, they will already attest the device's identity in the domain authentication process when users log on

### MAC Address/Static DHCP Approach
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- "I'd feel better with that approach. Listing the allowed MAC address/IP combos in a document could be your 'verification' step. At least there's some computer logic involved."

### Domain Join/MDM Enrollment
- Remote devices that are domain joined or MDM enrolled attest device identity during domain authentication process
- This satisfies device authentication requirement

## Edge Cases

### Cloud-Only Environments with Office Network
Question: "If all our data is in the cloud and nothing is on-prem, would this apply at all to an office network? Would we need mac filtering for an office network that has no servers or data in it?"

Response (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "How do you access your data in the cloud? Does it not come down from the cloud onto your endpoints for editing? For building new CUI information products?"
- "What happens when you print something?"
- Even cloud-only environments have endpoints that process CUI - those endpoints are in scope

### Remote Workers and Home Wi-Fi
Concern raised: "What about users who work remotely? Why would I need to put mac filtering in an office that is just used for internet purposes if remote users are doing the same thing in their homes?"

Response (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- What category is their device? This is where categorizing assets helps determine scope and where controls are needed
- Generally, endpoints will be CUI Assets and subject to all security controls
- 3.10.6 requires a plan for alternate work sites (Work from Home CUI Protection Plan)

### Specialized Assets (SAs) and Device Authentication
Per Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "This is exactly the kind of control most SAs aren't expected to meet, as they can't. You don't have to segment them, although I always like that when possible."
- Specialized Assets that cannot technically meet 3.5.2[c] may have alternative approaches documented

---

## Evidence Examples

- Domain join records
- MDM enrollment confirmation
- MAC address/IP documentation for physical inventory approach
- Physical inventory of devices in controlled areas
- Work from Home CUI Protection Plan (for remote scenarios)
- Asset categorization documentation
