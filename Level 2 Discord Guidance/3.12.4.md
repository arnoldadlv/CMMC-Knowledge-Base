# 3.12.4 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Develop, document, and periodically update system security plans that describe system boundaries, system environments of operation, how security requirements are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems.

---

## Sufficient

### SSP Format and Structure
- **Spreadsheet format is acceptable:** Assessors confirm that using Excel spreadsheets (with tabs per domain) instead of Word documents is fine. "Lots of folks do it this way and it's fine. I don't think most assessors have a strong preference." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)
- **Key is completeness, not format:** "Just so long as the needed information is there." - Spock67 (CCA)

### Operating Environment Description (3.12.4[c])
- Must cover three major asset types per CMMC scoping guidance: **people, technology, and facilities**
- Example of sufficient narrative (from rybo):
  - "DIBCorp is a precision manufacturer, producing parts and assemblies for several DoD programs. Controlled unclassified is handled as a normal part of business during sales, quoting, engineering, and production activities."
  - "Users at DIBCorp work in a three building campus with perimeter security controls, internal security zones, and a monitored and supervised shop floor. Users access CUI digitally from controlled areas, and also handle printed documents on the shop floor."
  - "IT Systems are a mix of cloud resources and on-premises infrastructure..."

### Cloud SSP Boundaries
- For cloud IaaS (Azure), can put service-specific details (Azure AD, SPO, Azure Firewall, etc.) in a baseline, then SSP incorporates by reference
- Consider "striping" SSP statements by infrastructure tier (IaaS network, PaaS, IaaS operating systems, SaaS) to understand defense-in-depth and coverage

### Preferred Approach
- Brief narrative for each control specifically addressing each Assessment Objective (AO)
- Reference other docs for further detail as needed
- Contractor Risk Managed Assets and Specialized Assets must be documented within the SSP for Level 2

## Insufficient

### SSP Length Concerns
- 50-page SSP is a warning flag to assessors: "Since the template by itself from NIST is 24 pages... 50 sounds awfully short to me. As a C3PAO that would be an early flag that you are possibly not ready." - Spock67 (CCA)
- Short SSP may pass IF there is 300-500 pages of supporting documentation referenced

### Problematic SSP Approaches (from Lead CCA perspective):
1. **Reference-only SSPs:** "Some folks use the SSP just as a reference and point to info in other docs. I hate this kind. Makes me work too hard to find what I'm assessing."
2. **Kitchen-sink SSPs:** "Some people put everything but the kitchen sink into the SSP. I hate these too. I spend hours wading through fluff and filler trying to find the important stuff."

## Over-engineering

### SSP Format
- No need to maintain both Word AND Excel versions - pick one format and be consistent
- Over-detailed spreadsheets with excessive columns beyond what's needed for assessment

---

## Edge Cases

### Cloud Migration SSP Boundaries
- Question raised about updating existing SSPs when moving from on-prem DC to cloud IaaS
- Two approaches discussed:
  1. Keep system-specific SSPs based on the application
  2. Group all under a single Azure IaaS SSP with variations in control implementation described within each control

- The choice depends on manageability - if service-specific details can go in a baseline, a unified approach works

### Operating Environment Confusion
- 3.12.4[c] is NOT asking about what OS is running on systems
- It's about describing the operational context: how/where CUI is handled, physical environment, user workflows

---

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence Tracking (from practitioner example):
Spreadsheet with tabs per domain containing:
- Assessment Objective ID
- Assessment Objective Description
- Implementation Description (how requirement is met)
- Assessment Method (how it was verified during self-assessment)
- Evidence (file reference: policy/procedure/screenshot/etc.)
- Met? (checkbox)
- Date Assessed

### Supporting Documentation
- 300-500 pages of supporting documentation expected alongside SSP
- Diagrams/pictures are valuable: "Can use pretty pictures as well. Everyone loves pretty pictures/diagrams"

## Key Quotes

**On SSP Format Flexibility:**
> "Lots of folks do it this way and it's fine. I don't think most assessors have a strong preference." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On SSP Length Warning:**
> "Since the template by itself from NIST is 24 pages... 50 sounds awfully short to me. As a C3PAO that would be an early flag that you are possibly not ready. Do you have 300-500 pages of supporting documentation referenced by the SSP? If not... I would be concerned that you have enough." - Spock67, CCA

**On Ideal SSP Structure:**
> "My personal preference is to have a brief narrative for each control, specifically addressing each AO, in the SSP and then also reference other docs for further detail as needed." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On Cloud SSP Approach:**
> "For me, it's all about manageability. If I can put most of the service-specific details (Azure AD, SPO, Azure Firewall, etc.) in a baseline, then my SSP can incorporate those by reference and include multiple services." - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

**On Content Over Format:**
> "Just so long as the needed information is there." - Spock67, CCA

## Topics Not Discussed

- Specific pass/fail scenarios with detailed examples
- POA&M handling for SSP deficiencies
- SSP update frequency specifics (beyond that it must be defined per 3.12.4[g])
- Signature/approval requirements for SSP
- Version control requirements for SSP updates
- Handling of inherited controls documentation
