# 3.8.4 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Mark media with necessary CUI markings and distribution limitations.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.4[a] media containing CUI is marked with applicable CUI markings.
- 3.8.4[b] media containing CUI is marked with distribution limitations.

---

## Sufficient

- **Policy + Physical Marking on Removable Media**: Training policy that clearly trains users that all media with CUI must have markings, combined with physical markings on external media provided by IT indicating it contains Controlled Data. (Jake, Fellow - passed assessment)

- **Removable/Portable Media Marking Only**: No requirement to mark laptops, just removable media. The assessment guide for 3.8 controls refers to paper, microfilm, CDs, USBs, external/removable drives, other optical discs - but purposely omits fixed drives/computers/laptops. (Jake, Fellow; Cuipacabra, CCP)

- **Minimal CUI Marking for Space-Limited Media**: Per NARA guidance, for USB drives with space limitations: "At a minimum, mark media with the CUI Control Marking ('CONTROLLED' or 'CUI') and the designating agency." A general CUI marking suffices when multiple CUI types exist on space-limited media. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Controlled Area Exemption**: Not marking computers in a controlled area is acceptable per the original security control (MP-3). Controlled areas can be established with physical barriers (rooms, storage containers) OR procedural controls (direct physical control). (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **FedRAMP Parameters**: FedRAMP assigned parameters still require media marking for removable media/portable storage, but allow exemptions for other media types when inside a controlled environment. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Paper Media**: Media includes paper. Mark paper documents with appropriate CUI markings. Assessors are not generally digging in hard on whether documents are properly marked. (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)

## Insufficient

- **Logon Banners Alone**: "Boot up the computer to see the CUI logon banner" as a means of satisfying 3.8.4 does not sit right with experts. Logon banners are questionable as the sole method for marking media. (Uncouth, CCP)

- **Encrypted USB Without Marking**: Even if a USB device is FIPS encrypted, it still needs to be marked as CUI or CONTROLLED. DoD still considers encrypted CUI to be CUI. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Unmarked Removable Media**: Removable/portable media must be marked even in controlled environments per FedRAMP parameters. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

---

## Over-engineering

- **CUI Stickers on Laptops**: Many CCAs do not require CUI labels on workstations. There's a widely held belief that a visible CUI sticker on a laptop elevates security risk by making it a target. Primes passed DIBCAC assessments without laptop stickers. (Tarnish, Certified CMMC Assessor; Jeff Baldwin, CCA)

- **Full Category Markings on Small Media**: NARA guidance explicitly states that due to space limitations on USB sticks, it may not be possible to include CUI Category, Subcategory, or Limited Dissemination Control Markings. Minimal marking is acceptable. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Marking All Fixed Drives**: NIST avoids discussion about fixed (internal) drives because there are dedicated controls for full disk encryption (AC-19(5)) and encrypted data at rest (SC-28(1)). The MP controls handle remaining risks. The "screwdriver test" applies - if a screwdriver is required to remove a drive, it's a fixed drive, not removable media. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow; Jeff Baldwin, CCA)

---

## Edge Cases

- **Work From Home Laptops**: In the remote work-from-home landscape, a sticker seems required for laptops leaving controlled spaces. However, procedural controls (direct physical control, screen locks, closing files when others enter) can establish a controlled area concept even at home. A Bitlocker FIPS encrypted laptop that is turned off or screen locked does not provide access to CUI. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow; Uncouth, CCP)

- **Thin Clients That Transmit CUI**: Thin client laptops that transmit CUI via Teams calls or burn CDs may not need labeling if they don't store CUI locally. The definition of "system media" is meant to differentiate digital media from removable media. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Receiving Unmarked CUI from Primes**: If downstream from a prime and receiving documents believed to be CUI but unmarked, don't overthink it. You may not have insight into whether government owns the data or it's proprietary. ITAR/EAR marking violations are a different, more serious problem. (MonkSecurity, CCP)

- **Multiple CUI Types on One USB**: General CUI marking suffices. Per NARA, space limitations mean you may not include all categories. Mark with "CONTROLLED" or "CUI" and designating agency at minimum. (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Envelope Analogy**: Question raised about why marking a USB drive or CD-ROM case is different from not marking an envelope containing CUI documents (which you shouldn't mark to avoid alerting random observers). This tension remains unresolved. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)

## Evidence Examples

- CUI marking training policy that instructs users to mark all media with CUI
- Physical labels/stickers on removable media (USB drives, external hard drives, CDs)
- Demonstrated asset ID system for tracking CUI-containing devices internally
- Policy defining controlled areas and when marking exemptions apply
- Evidence of FIPS encryption on removable media (still requires marking)
- Examples of marked paper documents with CUI headers
- Evidence of physical markings showing "CONTROLLED" or "CUI" plus designating agency

## Key Quotes

> "The most 'creative' solution is not marking computers in a controlled area, because that allowance is described in the original security control (MP-3). The FedRAMP assigned parameters still require media marking for removable media/portable storage, though."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "No requirement to mark laptops, just removable media"
> -- Jake (Fellow)

> "When I read the assessment guide for all 3.8 controls, the 'media' it refers to is not computers with fixed drives. It's talking about paper, microfilm, CDs, USBs, external/removable drives, other optical discs.....but it purposely goes out of it's way to omit fixed drives/computers/laptops"
> -- Cuipacabra, CCP

> "I believe NIST avoids discussion about fixed (internal) drives because there are dedicated controls for full disk encryption (AC-19(5)) and encrypted data at rest (SC-28(1)). The MP bats clean-up on the remaining risks and use cases."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "According to best practice, yes [encrypted USB should be marked]. I'm basing this on two things: 1. DoD still considers encrypted CUI to be CUI. 2. Federally assigned parameters from FedRAMP allow you to exempt anything but removable/portable storage from marking when inside a controlled environment."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "Due to space limitations it may not be possible to include CUI Category, Subcategory, or Limited Dissemination Control Markings. At a minimum, mark media with the CUI Control Marking ('CONTROLLED' or 'CUI') and the designating agency."
> -- NARA CUI Marking Handbook (cited by rybo)

> "It says mark media. That includes paper. At least we have gotten past the long standing debate on whether contractors could mark CUI at all. There is still a lot of grey area there on what should be marked when and by whom. I dont see any assessors digging in hard on whether or not you are properly marking documents."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, CCP)

> "Many CCA do not require CUI labels on workstations. It may be a point you want to ask when you interview your candidate C3PAO. There's a widely held belief that a visible CUI sticker on a laptop elevates security risk by making it a target"
> -- Tarnish (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "The biggest thing is none of the primes use stickers and they passed DIBCAC assessments just fine."
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, CCP, Fellow, RPO)

> "DIBCAC has the stance whether it requires a screwdriver to remove or not. If you can easily remove media without a screwdriver then you should label that."
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, CCP, Fellow, RPO)

> "The more common narrative I've heard is that if a screwdriver is required to remove a drive, then it's a 'fixed drive' not external/removable/portable media."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)
