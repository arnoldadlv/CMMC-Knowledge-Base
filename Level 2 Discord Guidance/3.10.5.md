# 3.10.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Control and manage physical access devices.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.10.5[a] physical access devices are identified.
- 3.10.5[b] physical access devices are controlled.
- 3.10.5[c] physical access devices are managed.

---

## Sufficient

- **Badges and keys identified as physical access devices** - Confirmed as the core scope of this control (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)
- **Minimizing key distribution for perimeter doors** - Reduces re-keying burden when employees leave without returning keys (rybo)
- **Access-controlled building entry, elevators, and stairwells** - Layered access control approach validated as well thought out (MonkSecurity - CCP)
- **Keycard access to restricted floors** - Electronic access control for CUI-processing areas
- **Background checks and personnel screening** - Screened personnel in access-controlled areas satisfies control requirements

## Insufficient

- **Cubicle areas open to the public** - Explicitly called out as problematic: "If cubicle area is open to the public, you have a problem" (MonkSecurity - CCP)
- **Policy-only restrictions without physical barriers** - Open cubicle areas where unscreened staff can walk through, even with signage and floor markings, raises concerns (though alternative safeguards may apply under 3.10.1)

## Over-engineering

- **Full-height walls with locked doors around cubicle areas** - Discussed as potentially excessive; one assessor noted "I personally prefer the assurance a physical card access system gives you, but arguments can be made for other implementations" (Liatris, LCCA - Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **Note:** The discussion indicated that full enclosure of CUI work areas is not necessarily required if alternative safeguards exist, though this crosses into 3.10.1 territory

## Edge Cases

- **Cubicle environments with CUI work** - Extended discussion on whether 6ft partitions with 8ft ceilings (leaving a gap) are acceptable when unscreened staff have floor access. Key points:
  - Not necessarily required to fully enclose cubicle areas with physical barriers
  - Alternative safeguards like guards or policies (lock screen when someone approaches) may be acceptable
  - This scenario was redirected to 3.10.1 as more relevant to limiting access than managing access devices

- **Shared kitchen on CUI floor** - Scenario: Only floor with in-scope staff also has only kitchen, so all staff have keycard access. Resolution hinges on whether non-CUI staff are screened.

- **"Controlled" vs "Managed" distinction** - One assessor asked: "Anyone have thoughts on controlled vs managed? The NIST glossary isn't very helpful in defining those two" (Liatris, LCCA). **No definitive answer was provided in the thread.**

## Evidence Examples

- Keycard/badge access system for building entry
- Keycard access logs for elevators and stairwells
- Personnel screening records (background checks)
- Key distribution records/logs
- Physical access device inventory (keys, badges, fobs)

## Key Quotes

> "Yes. Badges and keys. Try to minimize who gets keys to the perimeter doors, so you don't need to re-key the building if someone leaves and won't return theirs."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow/MEP)

> "For personnel screening, who is in the area? If cubicle area is open to the public, you have a problem. If all personnel have been screened, that is fine."
> -- MonkSecurity - CCP (Established Member/Verified)

> "I think 3.10.1 has considerations for alternative safeguards like having guards or policies that when someone approaches they lock their screen or close applications. I personally prefer the assurance a physical card access system gives you, but arguments can be made for other implementations."
> -- Liatris, LCCA (Certified CMMC Assessor/C3PAO)

> "If your users don't do any CUI work in those cubicles then it's fine. If they do CUI work, then access needs to be limited somehow."
> -- Liatris, LCCA (Certified CMMC Assessor/C3PAO)

## Topics Not Discussed

- Specific pass/fail assessment scenarios with definitive outcomes
- Detailed evidence rejection examples
- Audit log retention requirements for access devices
- Remote/satellite office physical access device management
- Visitor badge management procedures
- Electronic vs. mechanical lock comparisons
