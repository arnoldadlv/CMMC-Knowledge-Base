# 3.13.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational systems.

## Sufficient

- **NIST SP 800-160 Vol 1 Rev 1 security design principles** - Specifically Appendix E for systems engineering principles and architectural designs. The taxonomy sections can be used to distinguish between architectural designs vs. SSE principles (rybo, Fellow/Moderator).
- **CIS Benchmarks/STIGs** - Can serve as "principles that promote effective information security" and also helps answer 3.4.2 (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **Zero Trust architecture** - Can be used as principles or architectural designs (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **"Use COTS software, don't develop in-house"** - Acceptable approach for assessment objectives [b] and [e] only (software development techniques). Does NOT satisfy [a,c,d,f] (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **For GCC/GCC High users** - Must still articulate: how you access it, what designs/principles led to those decisions, how endpoints are hardened, and what led to those hardening decisions (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **SEI/CMU Top 10 Secure Coding Practices** - Referenced as valid for secure software development techniques (Liatris, CCA).

## Insufficient

- **"We don't develop software"** - Only addresses assessment objectives [b] and [e]. You still must address architectural designs [a,d] and systems engineering principles [c,f]. This is broader than software development (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **Claiming software development is "out of scope"** - Incorrect framing. Even if you don't develop software, architectural designs and systems engineering principles still apply to any IT footprint (multiple users).
- **No documented principles** - Assessment objectives require you to IDENTIFY the principles/designs first [a,b,c], then PROVE they are EMPLOYED [d,e,f] (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Software as CUI (deliverable software, not information system software)** - Control applies only to software used in the information system, not software that IS the CUI product. If you develop software as a deliverable that is the CUI itself, this is a different scoping question. Proprietary software with government-specific configurations should have firm boundaries drawn between the two (MonkSecurity, JB).
- **Small business with no IT development** - Still must identify and implement design principles from 800-160 on network/systems and document in SSP which principles were identified and implemented (question raised but not fully answered).
- **Legacy systems built before compliance effort** - Systems designed before NIST/CMMC compliance may result in many POA&Ms. Question raised about whether rest of SSP serves as proof of this control (question raised, not fully answered).
- **Contract-required SCA** - If contract requires Source Code Analysis, that answers the software development portion directly (teeefunny).

## Evidence Examples

- **Document identifying the architectural designs** that promote effective information security [a]
- **Document identifying software development techniques** (or documentation that COTS is used exclusively) [b]
- **Document identifying systems engineering principles** - Reference to 800-160 Vol 1 Rev 1 compliance document [c]
- **Proof of implementation** - Assessor needs to see the identified designs/principles are actually employed [d,e,f]
- **SSP control implementation** - Must explicitly state which principles were identified AND implemented
- **Assessment structure:** "[a,b,c] are identified: you tell them what they're looking for. [d,e,f] now prove it is done" (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow)

## Key Quotes

> "I use the security design principles in 800-160 Vol 1 for my architectural designs and my SSE principles, depending on the taxonomy section they come from." - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "My most common software development technique is 'use COTS software, and don't develop in-house.'" - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "'don't develop software in house' is only an answer to [b,e]" - Uncouth (CCP/Fellow)

> "it's a lot broader than solely software dev" - Uncouth (CCP/Fellow)

> "great, you use GCC. how do you access it? what designs or principles led you to those decisions? how are endpoints hardened? what led you to those decisions?" - Uncouth (CCP/Fellow)

> "CIS Benchmarks/STIG could be principles that promote effective information security. also helps you answer 3.4.2. zero trust could be principles or even architectural designs, if you go that route" - Uncouth (CCP/Fellow)

> "My take is this only applies to software used in the Information system." - MonkSecurity (CCP) [regarding software-as-CUI edge case]

> "It doesn't make sense to me that this only applies to in-house software development. Consider the family it's in - 3.13. What else is in here? Network architecture, encryption. I think this is asking for you to define how you design your network and your overall 'information system'" - Michael (Consultant)

> "[a,b,c] are identified: you tell them what they're looking for" - Uncouth (CCP/Fellow)

> "[d,e,f] now prove it is done" - Uncouth (CCP/Fellow)

## Assessment Objectives Breakdown (from discussion)

| Objective | Area | Requirement |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 3.13.2[a] | Architectural designs | Are identified |
| 3.13.2[b] | Software development techniques | Are identified |
| 3.13.2[c] | Systems engineering principles | Are identified |
| 3.13.2[d] | Architectural designs | Are employed |
| 3.13.2[e] | Software development techniques | Are employed |
| 3.13.2[f] | Systems engineering principles | Are employed |

**Key insight:** "No in-house software development" only addresses [b] and [e]. Organizations must still address all six objectives.
