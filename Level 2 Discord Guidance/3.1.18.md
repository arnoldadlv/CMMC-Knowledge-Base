# 3.1.18 - Expertise Overlay
## Control connection of mobile devices.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.18[a] mobile devices that process, store, or transmit CUI are identified.
- 3.1.18[b] mobile device connections are authorized.
- 3.1.18[c] mobile device connections are monitored and logged.

---

## Sufficient

### MAM (Mobile Application Management) with Intune
- MAM with Intune passed DIBCAC audit - confirmed by Jake (Fellow, passed DIBCAC assessment)
- Works with BYOD (no corporate-owned devices required), mix of iOS and Android
- MAM with GCC or GCC-High has passed "many assessments" per Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)
- Intune MAM controls acceptable when documented in policies and procedures

### Prohibition Approach
- Blocking mobile devices from CUI enclave is acceptable, but do NOT mark as "N/A"
- Instead, mark as MET and describe what you are doing to prevent access
- Per DFARS 7012, need DoD CIO permission to mark anything as N/A

### Separate Email Approach
- Using a dedicated CUI email address (e.g., john.smith.cui@company.com) that is not accessible from phones can remove devices from scope
- Caveat: Only works "provided everybody follows the rules" (skepticism noted by rybo, Moderator)

### Unmanaged Devices with Remote Wipe
- Setting up phones as unmanaged devices where you can remote wipe apps containing CUI is acceptable
- Must be documented in policies and procedures
- Must enforce encryption to access CUI stored in M365 GCC-H

---

## Insufficient

### Marking as N/A
- Do NOT mark 3.1.18 or 3.1.19 as "N/A" even if you prohibit mobile devices
- Rejected approach: claiming the control is not applicable when you're blocking access

### Mobile Devices as CRMA when they contain CUI
- "You'd be extremely hard pressed to convince an assessor that a phone that contains CUI is a CRMA because it's MAM protected" - John (Established Member)
- If device actually stores/processes CUI, it's a CUI asset, not a Contractor Risk Managed Asset

### MAM for FIPS Compliance (edge case)
- Claiming MAM encryption satisfies FIPS requirement is problematic unless MAM creates a FIPS-validated encrypted folder
- Assessor held tightly to requiring each device to have a FIPS module in High Confidence audit
- Intune configures local keys but doesn't manage keys directly - this distinction matters

## Edge Cases

### Laptop vs. Mobile Device Definition
- **Critical distinction**: A laptop is NOT a mobile device per NIST/800-171 definition
- "A laptop is a mobile computer not mobile device" - Jake (Fellow, confirmed in DIBCAC)
- Mobile device definition (NIST): small form factor, designed to work wirelessly, non-removable storage, self-contained power
- Laptops are "mobile computing platforms" not "mobile devices"
- **However**: Some assessors outside this community incorrectly treat laptops as mobile devices - confirmed incident in mock assessment
- "Consensus in this community, but lots of wacky ones in the greater community" - MonkSecurity

### Laptops not used for CUI
- If laptop is not used for CUI, it would be considered a CRMA
- Explain how you keep it from getting to CUI data

### MFA Requirement Difference
- A laptop must have MFA, a mobile device does not (different control applicability)

### FIPS Validation Challenge
- Not every mobile device has FIPS validated module
- "Technically I can only find FIPS modules for older iPhones and Google devices. Some Samsung devices but not others."
- This creates challenges for listing mobile devices as CUI assets

### Commercial vs. GCC/GCC-High
- MAM approach has passed with GCC or GCC-High but NOT commercial tenant

## Evidence Examples

### For MAM Implementation
- Intune MDM configuration policies (CIS Level 1)
- App protection policies showing encryption enforcement
- Policies preventing data move outside MDM container
- Documentation in policies and procedures

### For Prohibition Approach
- Policy stating mobile devices are prohibited from CUI enclave
- Technical controls blocking access (Conditional Access policies, etc.)
- Describe what you ARE doing, not just what you're NOT allowing

### For Separate Email Approach
- Email routing configuration
- Policy document
- User acknowledgment forms

> "No, per the definition above a laptop is not a mobile device" - Jake (Fellow)

> "A laptop is a mobile computer not mobile device" - Jake (Fellow)

> "That is NIST's definition" - Jake (Fellow), re: laptop not being mobile device

> "In your DIBCAC assessment, did the assessors clarify/agree that a laptop is not a mobile device?" "Yes they did" - rafaAmd101 and Jake exchange

> "A laptop must have MFA, a mobile device does not" - Jake (Fellow)

> "MAM got me through a DIBCAC audit no problem" - Jake (Fellow)

> "We have no corporate owned devices, and a mix of iOS and Android" - Jake (Fellow)

> "No. Don't use N/A - instead talk about what you are doing to stop them from accessing it" - Jake (Fellow)

> "The general wisdom is to mark as met, and then describe in this case how you prevent access. In keeping with 7012 you need permission from the DoD CIO to mark something as NA which is the cause for this approach." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Many assessments have been passed with #2 [Intune with MDM/MAM] in GCC or GCCH but not commercial." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "We did #2 and passed an assessment using MAM controls." - John (Established Member)

> "you'd be extremely hard pressed to convince an assessor that a phone that contains CUI is a CRMA because it's MAM protected" - John (Established Member)

> "I had a High Confidence audit where an assessor held tightly to each device needed a FIPS module" - Matt Pierce

> "Provided everybody follows the rules, then yes. *Narrator: 'They didn't follow the rules.'*" - rybo (Moderator), on separate CUI email approach

> "Consensus in this community, but lots of wacky ones in the greater community." - MonkSecurity, on laptop definition disagreement

> "Got dinged during a mock assessment on 3.1.18 as I stated we do not have any mobile devices in-scope (phones). Assessor response was 'what about laptops?'" - ervalex (Certified CMMC Assessor)
