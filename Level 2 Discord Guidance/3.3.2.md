# 3.3.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users, so they can be held accountable for their actions.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.3.2[a]: The content of the audit records needed to support the ability to uniquely trace users to their actions is defined.
- 3.3.2[b]: Audit records, once created, contain the defined content.

## Sufficient

**AU-3 Content as Baseline:** Discussion indicates that the AU-3 standard content elements (what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the event) can be used to define what is sufficient for tracing users to actions. However, this is configuration-dependent.

**Key Insight from Certified Assessor (Joro):** The sufficiency depends on how data collection is configured. Evidence should include:
1. Show how the audit system is configured to include user identity detail
2. Provide a sample of the system actually collecting at that level

**"Power of Definition" Principle (from Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor):** The OSA has the power to define what content is needed for their environment. As long as they define it and then demonstrate their audit records contain that defined content, they meet the control.

## Edge Cases

**Configuration vs. Policy Question:** The discussion highlights a nuance - simply having a policy that references AU-3 content requirements may not be enough. The assessor should verify:
- The actual configuration of the audit system matches the defined requirements
- Live samples demonstrate the configured collection is working as intended

---

## Evidence Examples

**Discussed Evidence Approaches:**
1. Audit system configuration showing user identity capture settings
2. Sample audit records demonstrating actual collection at the required detail level
3. Documentation defining what content is needed for user traceability (can reference AU-3 elements)

> "I am thinking that it depends on how the data collection is configured. So possibly ask the OSA to show how the audit system is configured to include that level of detail. Then ask to see a sample of the system actually collecting at that level."

> "You have the power of definition. I think it is what you say it is."
> - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor) - in response to whether AU-3 content is sufficient for 3.3.2[a]
