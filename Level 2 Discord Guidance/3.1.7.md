# 3.1.7 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.7[a] privileged functions are defined
- 3.1.7[b] non-privileged users are defined
- 3.1.7[c] non-privileged users are prevented from executing privileged functions
- 3.1.7[d] the execution of privileged functions is captured in audit logs

---

## Sufficient

### Defining Privileged Functions
- **Define categories of functions rather than exhaustively listing every action** - Use comprehensive but not overly granular definitions
- Example definition from FedRAMP AC-6(2): "Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions"
- Definition from rybo's internal documentation: "Privileged functions are any human-initiated command executed on an information system involving the control, monitoring, or administration of the system including security functions and associated security-relevant information. Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users."

### Audit Logging (Objective [d])
- **Objective [d] only requires capturing the events** - it does not require reviewing them for unauthorized activity (that is covered by 3.14.6, 3.12.3, and 3.1.2)
- **Company can decide which event IDs to capture** - there is no mandated list of specific Windows Event IDs
- A "reasonable attempt" to list and capture relevant event IDs is sufficient, especially for micro companies (per Spock67, CCA)
- Having a rationale for what you picked is important

### Scope Clarification
- **800-171 requirements don't apply to systems that don't handle (store, process, transmit) CUI** - Developers with local admin on machines not touching CUI are outside scope
- Focus on solving this on CUI assets first and foremost

---

## Insufficient

### Defining Privileged Functions
- **Circular definitions are problematic** - "Privileged functions are defined as the set of functions granted by successful UAC authentication" was flagged as circular given the requirement

### Applications Without Logging
- **Apps with no logging capability and no way to federate with AD** are problematic - suggestion was to "scrap it and use something else" unless mission critical with no alternatives

---

## Over-engineering

### Event ID Lists
- **Do NOT include specific Event IDs in company policy** - Policy should just say you must log privileged functions; put specific Event IDs in baselines instead
- **Hiring people to watch video recordings of privileged sessions full-time** - flagged as potentially overthinking the requirement
- **Enumerating each specific action a privileged account can take** - "that could be an insane list" - use categories instead

### Documenting Privileged Functions
- User worried about going down a "rabbit hole of details" for documenting privileged functions - the category-based definition approach is simpler and sufficient

---

## Edge Cases

### Developers with Local Admin
- **Developers needing local admin but not touching CUI** - If their computer does not store, process, or transmit CUI, the control does not apply to those systems. Prioritize CUI assets first.

### Apps Without Native Logging
- For local apps with web UI privileged access but no logging:
  - Consider if you can federate the web app's accounts with Active Directory
  - Consider limiting web UI access over the network to specific IPs
  - Consider adding an authentication layer that can block requests to privileged functions based on authenticated user

### Still Need Logging Even When Prevention Works
- Even if you have "blocked the execution of privileged function by non-privileged users completely" you still need to log execution of privileged functions by privileged users (confirmed by Spock67, CCA)

```

### Notes on Event Logging
- Several Event IDs require enabling Advanced Audit policies - they are not enabled by default
- Event IDs 4728 and 4737 are commonly used for investigating when users are added to security groups
- IR team should have input on what needs to be captured for baselines

## Key Quotes

**rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP):**
> "Privileged functions are any human-initiated command executed on an information system involving the control, monitoring, or administration of the system including security functions and associated security-relevant information."

**rybo on Objective [d]:**
> "3.1.7[d] only cares that you're capturing the Event IDs in the first place. Reviewing them for unauthorized activity is more aligned with 3.14.6, 3.12.3, and 3.1.2."

**rybo on Policy vs Baselines:**
> "I also think it's a bad idea to include specific EIDs in company policy. Just say that you must log privileged functions. Include the event IDs in your baselines."

**Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):**
> "I certainly have not seen any such list! That would be useful though. As an assessor, would need you to show your process. I think if you make a reasonable attempt to list some ids and capture them that would be sufficient for me. Especially for a micro company."

**Spock67 on Event ID Selection:**
> "The standard does not have that level of specificity in it. I think you the company can decide what to capture in audit logs as long as you have a rational for what you picked."

**itsallsimple (C3PAO):**
> "No, you do not need to enumerate each specific action, that could be an insane list."

**JB (citing FedRAMP):**
> "You should be comprehensive but don't need to be super granular... you can define categories of functions which require privileged access, rather than exhaustively listing every possible action which falls into those categories."

**Alabaster on Event ID Documentation:**
> "Agree with the statement about don't specify in company policy. The policy is intended to give an expectation. You can document this in a baseline, but I prefer to capture this in your process for incident response. IR is the area that needs that information."

**itsallsimple on Apps Without Logging:**
> "Unless this is some mission critical app that there is no other option for I would handle the situation by scrapping it and using something else."
