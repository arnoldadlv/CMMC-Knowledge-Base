# 3.4.4 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation.

**Source:** Cooey COE Discord - configuration-management channel

---

## Sufficient

- **Security impact evaluation field in change control request** - A field that documents whether the change will alter existing or create new security configuration settings, or require updates to documentation. Passed C3PAO gap assessment. (MysteryShack)

- **Excel spreadsheet documenting security impact analysis** - One or two sentences describing research about a proposed change, sometimes a paragraph or two. Question raised whether this is sufficient; confirmed by someone who passed C3PAO gap assessment with similar approach.

- **CCB (Change Control Board) with security approval** - Any changes through the CCB have to be approved by security. (ace_rimmer, Fellow role)

- **Qualys patch management** - Acceptable if it tells you whether a patch will improve a system's security posture (remediate a particular CVE). The key question from rybo: "Does [the tool] tell you whether a patch will improve a system's security posture?" (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

- **Deferring Windows feature updates by 180 days while allowing security updates** - Allows time to read about new features in biannual updates and decide whether to disable/reconfigure them. Security updates still flow through. (rybo)

## Insufficient

No explicit examples of rejected or insufficient evidence were discussed in this channel.

---

## Over-engineering

No discussion found on over-engineering for this control.

## Edge Cases

- **Auto-updates on PCs and Macs** - Does NOT need to be turned off entirely. The distinction is between:
  - **Feature updates** (new functionality) - require impact analysis, can be deferred
  - **Security updates** (remediating flaws) - can flow automatically

  Discussion confirms you can keep auto-update enabled for security patches while deferring feature updates. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA; rybo)

- **Windows versions falling out of support** - A practical risk mentioned: PCs can stop receiving security updates because the version is so far behind in feature updates that it becomes EOL without notification. Recommendation to monitor/check periodically. (Glenda Snodgrass)

- **Microsoft adding features without notice** - Referenced example: "Microsoft added Xbox Live streaming to Windows without telling anyone" - illustrates why feature update deferral gives time for security review.

## Evidence Examples

**Process-based approaches (confirmed acceptable):**
1. Change control request form with security impact evaluation field
2. Excel spreadsheet documenting security impact analysis for each change
3. CCB requiring security approval for all changes

**Tool-based approaches by change type (from rybo):**
1. **OS changes:** Run changes in test environment + ad hoc vulnerability scan. If new vulnerabilities emerge, address them.
2. **Software changes:** Run static code analysis tools to check for common misconfigurations.
3. **All other changes:** Ask whether the change is more restrictive than previous configuration. If more restrictive, generally improving security.

**Windows-specific implementation:**
- GPOs or Windows Update Rings (Intune) to defer feature updates while allowing security updates

## Key Quotes

> "It's usually a process that may involve a few tools. For operating system changes: run the changes in a test environment and run an ad hoc vulnerability scan. If any new vulnerabilities emerge as a result of the change, then you'll need to address it." - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "For all other changes: ask yourself whether the change is more restrictive than the previous configuration. If it's more restrictive, then you are generally improving security." - rybo

> "We have it as part of our overall change control. Any changes through the CCB (Change Control Board) have to be approved by security" - ace_rimmer (Fellow)

> "Does Qualys patch management tell you whether a patch will improve a system's security posture (remediate a particular CVE)?" - rybo (key question for evaluating if a tool satisfies this control)

> "there is a security impact evaluation field in the change control request that gets completed. we look to see if the change will alter existing or create new security configuration settings, or require updates to documentation." - MysteryShack (passed C3PAO gap assessment)

> "in addition to just a general 'is this a horrible idea' sanity check for security overall" - MysteryShack

> "On Windows, this might include deferring feature updates (new functionality that requires impact analysis) while still allowing security updates (remediating flaws)." - rybo

> "If you defer feature updates by 180 days, you'll always have enough time to read about new features in biannual updates and decide whether you should disable/reconfigure them." - rybo
