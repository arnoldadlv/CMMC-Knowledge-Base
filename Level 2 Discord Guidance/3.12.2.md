# 3.12.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Develop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.12.2[a] deficiencies and vulnerabilities to be addressed by the plan of action are identified.
- 3.12.2[b] a plan of action is developed to correct identified deficiencies and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities.
- 3.12.2[c] the plan of action is implemented to correct identified deficiencies and reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities.

## Sufficient

- **POAM Tickets in Jira/ticketing system**: CCA confirmed that using a POAM Ticket Template in a ticketing system (e.g., Jira) with proper fields (assigned to, date opened, date closed) is acceptable. Can reference operational POAM checklist as well.

- **Excel spreadsheet with separate tabs for POAM and OPA**: Lead CCA confirmed this approach is acceptable - "diff tabs is fine." The form/format does not matter; it is the content and intent that matters.

- **Documented workflow**: Having identified security gaps logged into tickets that then feed into an OPA tracker is acceptable.

- **Normal operational processes**: When performing routine incident response, vulnerability assessment, and monitoring according to documented procedures, you remain compliant even if issues are discovered.

- **Single mistakes/exceptions**: One workstation missing a configuration is "just a mistake. You fix it." This does not trigger POAM/OPA requirements on its own.

---

## Insufficient

- **Tracking process improvements as POAM items**: Consultant advised against tracking process improvements (e.g., migrating from spreadsheet to Jira for change tracking) in a POAM, as it could confuse assessors about compliance status and conflate with vulnerabilities that have strict remediation timelines.

- **Confusing OPA with POAM**: Multiple corrections throughout the thread emphasize these are distinct concepts. Using the terms interchangeably or misunderstanding the distinction will cause issues.

- **Incomplete OPA when questioned**: If you have not completed an OPA, the question of whether it's MET depends on context. OPA itself "is not a requirement. You don't need one unless you need one."

- **Rogue/discovered security issues not being addressed**: A discovered rogue VPN or similar security issue should go on POAM (not OPA) because it is within your control to fix. Items in your control with assignable completion dates belong on POAM.

## Edge Cases

### OPA vs. POAM Distinction (Critical)

**Definitions from 32 CFR 170:**

**Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M):** "A document that identifies tasks needing to be accomplished. It details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan, any milestones in meeting the tasks, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones."

**Operational Plan of Action (OPA):** "The formal artifact which identifies temporary vulnerabilities and temporary deficiencies (e.g., necessary information system updates, patches, or reconfiguration as threats evolve) in implementation of requirements and documents how they will be mitigated, corrected, or eliminated. The OSA defines the format. An operational plan of action does not identify a timeline for remediation and is not the same as a POA&M, which is associated with an assessment for remediation of deficiencies that must be completed within 180 days."

**Key Distinction - The "M" (Milestones):**
- **POAM**: You set completion dates/milestones because the issue is within your control
- **OPA**: No timeline because resolution is outside your control (e.g., waiting for vendor FIPS validation, vendor patch availability)

### When to Use OPA vs. POAM

| Scenario | Use | Reasoning |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| Waiting for firewall firmware FIPS validation from vendor | OPA | Out of your control |
| Vendor patch not yet available for known vulnerability | OPA | Out of your control |
| Enduring exception (no AV on CNC machine because it would break it) | OPA | Permanent documented exception |
| Discovered rogue VPN that needs remediation | POAM | Within your control, can assign resources and deadline |
| Missing STIG lockdown on one workstation | Neither - just fix it | Simple mistake, part of normal operations |
| Routine missing lockdowns becoming pattern | POAM | Root cause investigation needed |

### 7012 vs. CMMC Compliance Distinction

- **DFARS 7012**: Allows POAMs - you can be "compliant" with items on POAM
- **CMMC**: "Demands perfection" - items on POAM mean NOT MET for that control
- A rogue VPN scenario: "You'd be compliant for 7012 but not for CMMC"

### Threshold Question: When Does a Single Issue Become NOT MET?

Discussion explored: At what point does finding issues (e.g., 1 of 10,000 workstations missing configuration) become NOT MET?

**CCA Guidance:**
- One workstation missing something = "just a mistake. You fix it."
- If it becomes a routine event = put on POAM to investigate root cause
- Following your documented incident response/vulnerability assessment/monitoring procedures = you are good

## Evidence Examples

- POAM Ticket Template in ticketing system (Jira, etc.) with fields:
  - Assigned to
  - Date opened
  - Date closed
  - Security gap identified
  - Control reference

- Excel workbook with:
  - POAM tab: Tasks with milestones/completion dates for items in your control
  - OPA tab: Temporary/enduring deficiencies outside your control

- Example ticket format mentioned:
  - "POAM Ticket #123 - Security Gap 3.1.1 identified, added to OPA"
  - OPA tab shows control open with deficiency details

- Jira configuration with issue type "POAM" and flags to differentiate:
  - Process improvement
  - Deficiency correction
  - Vulnerability remediation

## Key Quotes

**On OPA vs. POAM confusion:**
> "I think you are confusing POAM with OPA. They are not the same thing." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On terminology:**
> "The 'M' is the key difference between these two. You set the milestones (completion dates) in a POAM. You can't in an OPA, because it's out of your control (like getting that newer version of your firewall's firmware FIPS validated.)" - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On format flexibility:**
> "Oh sure diff tabs is fine. But it's not two diff POAMs. It's a POAM and an OPA. The form doesn't matter; it's the content and intent." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On 7012 vs. CMMC:**
> "7012 allows POAMs. CMMC demands perfection." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On discovered issues:**
> "I say no, because it's not an enduring exception out of your control. You find a rogue VPN, you put it on POAM, you assign resources and a completion date, you kill it, you close the POAM." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On routine operations:**
> "Anytime you are doing the normal incident response, vulnerability assessment, monitoring....according to your procedures, you are good." - MonkSecurity, CCP

**On OPA as not mandatory:**
> "OPA is not a requirement. You don't need one unless you need one." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On one-off issues:**
> "One workstation missing something is just a mistake. You fix it. If it becomes a routine event, you put that on your POAM to investigate and try to solve the root problem." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On OPA use cases:**
> "[OPA] can also be used for enduring exceptions, like not putting antivirus on the PC running your CNC machine because it would break it." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

**On acceptable evidence:**
> "I asked a CCA exactly this and they said totally cool - basically have POAM Ticket Template, show your gaps in ticket with all proper fields (assigned to, date opened, date closed, etc) and then you could even point to operational poam checklist as reference also" - Topher, CCP
