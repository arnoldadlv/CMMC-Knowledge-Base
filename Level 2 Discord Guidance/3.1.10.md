# 3.1.10 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Use session lock with pattern-hiding displays to prevent access and viewing of data after a period of inactivity.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.10[a] the period of inactivity after which the system initiates a session lock is defined.
- 3.1.10[b] access to the system and viewing of data is prevented by initiating a session lock after the defined period of inactivity.
- 3.1.10[c] previously visible information is concealed via a pattern-hiding display after the defined period of inactivity.

## Sufficient

- **OS-level session lock** is typically sufficient when all access occurs from company-managed operating systems
- **Host OS session lock covering local VMs** - If using a local virtual machine that is not remotely accessible, the host OS session lock can satisfy this control for the VM (confirmed by Lead CCA Glenda Snodgrass and CCP Uncouth)
- **Session termination (3.1.11) as alternative** - For passwordless SSH environments where session lock is difficult to implement, terminating sessions instead of locking them is an acceptable approach

---

## Insufficient

- **Relying only on OS session lock when web apps are accessible from non-managed devices** - If a web application can be accessed from devices where you cannot guarantee the OS session lock will protect the app, you need session timeout at the application level as well
- **IP-locked web portals without app-level timeout** - Even if access is restricted to corporate IP addresses, if any device on the WiFi can access the login portal, application-level session timeout is still needed

---

## Over-engineering

- **Obscuring lock screen notifications when no CUI present** - One user implemented Intune policies to hide email/meeting/Teams notification content on lock screens. Lead CCA Glenda Snodgrass clarified: "Could there be CUI in the content of those notifications? If not, I don't see why they need to be obscured." The control is about hiding previously visible data, not all notifications.

## Edge Cases

### Web Applications
- **Question:** Does a web portal need its own session timeout if the OS has session lock?
- **Answer:** It depends. If you can guarantee all access happens from company-managed OSes with session lock, OS-level may suffice. If the web app can be accessed from non-corporate computers (even if IP-locked), you need app-level or WAF-level session timeout.

### Virtual Machines
- **Question:** Does a local VM need its own session lock if the host OS has it?
- **Answer:** For local-only VMs, host OS session lock is sufficient. However, if the VM is remotely accessible, that changes the analysis - any endpoint accessing the VM needs screen locking in place, OR remote access must be disabled entirely.

### Passwordless/SSH Key Authentication
- **Question:** How to implement session lock with SSH key auth and no passwords on the system?
- **Answer:** Old STIGs used TMOUT, newer ones use Vlock. For truly passwordless systems, session termination via 3.1.11 may be the appropriate alternative rather than trying to force session lock.

## Key Quotes

> "If you can't guarantee that an operating system's session lock will also prevent access to the web app, then you'll need to configure the web app (or a web app firewall) to lock sessions based on inactivity in addition to the OS."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "I'd be a bit more concerned if the VM is also remotely accessible. But if local only I agree I think you're still meeting intent there"
> -- Uncouth, CCP (Fellow, Certified CMMC Professional)

> "Best to clarify that any endpoint accessing the VM needs screen locking in place?"
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA (Fellow, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "I agree, kicking out the session if you can't lock it well would be best"
> -- ForrestOfCooey (re: passwordless SSH environments)

> "Could there be CUI in the content of those notifications? If not, I don't see why they need to be obscured."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA (on lock screen notifications)
