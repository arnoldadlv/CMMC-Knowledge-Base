# 3.13.14 - Expertise Overlay
**Control:** Control and monitor the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.13.14[a] use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies is controlled.
- 3.13.14[b] use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies is monitored.

## Sufficient

### Physical/Logical Separation
- VoIP on a completely separate network from CUI data network = MET
- **Key guidance:** "Met and explain how you keep it off your network" (ace_rimmer, Fellow)
- Per DoD FAQ A104: "If physically or cryptographically isolated from an information system processing CUI, this control would not apply"
- VLANs that segment desk phones from data traffic are acceptable separation

### Policy-Based Approach
- Acceptable to prohibit VoIP for CUI discussions via policy + training
- "Most companies will implement a policy 'Don't discuss CUI over phone lines (cell or VOIP)', then use GCC High Teams (or other FEDRAMP solution) if someone really needs to discuss verbally" (MonkSecurity, CCP)
- "Don't say 'not applicable' but your SSP saying you are compliant by having it on a separate network" (ace_rimmer, Fellow)

### No VoIP
- Not having VoIP at all is acceptable (confirmed with thumbs-up reaction)

### Control/Monitor Examples
- Control = "we only allow ZoomGov" (defining what VoIP is permitted)
- Monitor = "SIP traffic to/from ZoomGov only" (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow)

## Insufficient

No discussion found explicitly stating what implementations would fail an assessment.

## Over-engineering

### CUI Voice Discussion Concerns
- "I see in those cases people are using Teams in GCC High. I think this is part of a bigger problem in which trying to implement 800-171 with people who have history of classified processing leads them down a thought path that over complicates things." (MonkSecurity, CCP)
- "The whole discussing CUI is a bit flaky anyway, the laws, regulations, policy is more about documents." (MonkSecurity, CCP)

### Requiring FedRAMP for All VoIP
- Unless CUI is being screenshared, file shared, or discussed, FedRAMP may not be required
- Traditional VOIP can often be put out of scope

---

## Edge Cases

### Softphones on CUI Workstations
- Question raised: "For VOIP services that use 'soft phones' or a software application on a computer. Let's say that VOIP software is installed on a computer that processes CUI. Would that make the VOIP service in scope?"
- **No definitive answer provided in discussion** - this remains an open edge case

### Wi-Fi Calling on Cell Phones
- Question: Does Wi-Fi calling bring wireless into scope?
- Answer: "I would argue not... You could make the argument that it does but I don't think that would be consistent with the DoD's/Feds policy on CUI on the phone (essentially no restrictions). They allow faxing too which is digital transmission and unencrypted." (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)

### POTS vs VoIP Distinction
- "Voice over telephone = POTS. Copper lines, not data. 3.13.14 is for VoIP (data) traffic." (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow)
- DoD FAQ confirms: "Voice communication of CUI over the telephone is not addressed by NIST SP 800-171 or by DFARS clause 252.204-7012"

### Call Forwarding VoIP to Teams
- Question raised about out-of-scope VoIP forwarding to in-scope Teams
- Training provided: "someone calling in to a Teams call from a VOIP line/mobile line borks the protections and no CUI can be discussed while that connection is in place"
- **No definitive answer provided** - edge case remains open

### Outsourced VoIP (e.g., Vonage)
- Per DoD FAQ A104: "Even if outsourced, the internal IT system should have protections in place to control (albeit limited) and monitor VoIP within the system"

---

## Evidence Examples

### SSP Documentation
- Explain separation method (physical or cryptographic)
- Document approved VoIP solutions
- Reference policy prohibiting CUI discussion over non-compliant channels

### Policy Documents
- Acceptable Use Policy addressing VoIP
- IT policy stating CUI cannot be discussed over VoIP/cell phones
- Training documentation showing employee awareness

### Technical Controls
- Network diagrams showing VLAN separation
- Firewall rules limiting VoIP traffic
- Approved software list (e.g., "only ZoomGov")
- SIP traffic monitoring capability
