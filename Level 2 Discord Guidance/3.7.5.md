# 3.7.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Require multifactor authentication to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections and terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is complete.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.7.5[a] multifactor authentication is used to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections.
- 3.7.5[b] nonlocal maintenance sessions established via external network connections are terminated when nonlocal maintenance is complete.

## Sufficient

### Screen Sharing vs. Direct Access
Per Uncouth (Fellow/CCP):
- "If you're screen sharing that's different. You're controlling that. If they can access you directly, there's your problem. That's nonlocal maintenance"
- Screen sharing sessions (TeamViewer, UltraViewer, Teams) where YOU control the session may not require this control

### MSP Part of Authorization Boundary
Per medicooey (C3PAO/Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "I would argue what you would - it is part of the auth boundary"
- If MSP configuration management tools maintain persistent connections, can argue they are part of the authorization boundary
- For terminating sessions: "I'd also look to the fortimanager or whatever tool for access controls that terminate user sessions"

### ESP/Vendor CRM for MFA
Per Uncouth (Fellow/CCP):
- "If you have a need for true nonlocal maintenance, make sure the ESP (because they're an ESP in your example) gives you a CRM saying they do MFA for this nonlocal maintenance. Boom."

## Edge Cases

### MSP Persistent Connections (FortiManager Example)
Question: "If an MSSP is managing a customer's firewall through a configuration management tool, something like FortiManager, and the tool maintains a persistent connection with the firewalls what would you recommend as a mitigating control?"

Response (medicooey - C3PAO/Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "The non-local maintenance is just never complete :)"
- "But alas, 800-171 shows its age here again"
- Argues the MSP can be considered part of the authorization boundary
- Focus on user session termination rather than device connection termination

### What Counts as Nonlocal Maintenance?
Question: "What is an example of non local maintenance via external network connections?"

Response (Uncouth - Fellow/CCP):
- "Vendor remotes in to manage your OT, SAN, perform troubleshooting, etc."
- "In general using a means that isn't your typical way of connecting yourself"
- Applies to vendors or when you remote in yourself to perform maintenance in a unique way

### Screen Sharing Sessions
Question: "So if we do only screenshare type Maintenance (things like TeamViewer, ultraviewer, teams), then this wouldn't apply?"

Response (Uncouth - Fellow/CCP):
- Screen sharing where you control the session is different from direct access
- The key distinction is whether the vendor can access you directly

## Evidence Examples

- MFA configuration for remote maintenance tools
- Session timeout/termination settings in remote access tools
- CRM from ESP/vendors confirming MFA use for nonlocal maintenance
- Authorization boundary documentation including MSP tools
- User session termination logs from management tools
