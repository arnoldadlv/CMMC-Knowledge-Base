# 3.2.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Ensure that personnel are trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.2.2[a] information security-related duties, roles, and responsibilities are defined.
- 3.2.2[b] information security-related duties, roles, and responsibilities are assigned to designated personnel.
- 3.2.2[c] personnel are adequately trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties, roles, and responsibilities.

## Sufficient

**Training Requirements - OSC Defines What is Required:**
- Certifications are NOT mandatory - the OSC/OSA defines what training requirements are needed (ODP - Organization-Defined Parameter)
- Acceptable training sources include: certifications, conferences, college classes, online learning modules, vendor training videos, CDSE website courses (e.g., "Security for Security Personnel")
- For staff without formal certifications (common in small businesses): can define training as completion of specific vendor courses, internal training materials, or policy review with signature

**Evidence of Completion:**
- PDF certificates from training completion
- Email confirmation saying "done" or "just finished"
- LMS (Learning Management System) records integrated with HRIS
- Excel spreadsheet tracking matrix showing training materials reviewed and dates
- Stored copies of certification documents

**Role Definition for Objectives [a] and [b]:**
- Acceptable approach: "Person XYZ does access control on domain, firewall, VPN, GCC-High. Person ABC does configuration of domain, firewall, etc. Person ABC and XYZ do log reviews"
- Point staff to appropriate policies, procedures, and training materials with signature confirmation they received materials
- List training materials by system component (e.g., Firewall: see XYZ document/website/video)
- This approach has been confirmed to pass with DCSA

**Assessment Framework (The 3 AOs build on each other):**
1. Define it (what training is required for each role)
2. Tell the people to take it (assign)
3. Make sure they took it (track completion)

## Insufficient

**General Awareness Training Alone:**
- "General security awareness training should cover all-hands requirements... Now I would say that being the only infosec set of responsibilities and just doing general user awareness training is not adequate or sufficient for all aspects of this control." - Spock67 (CCA)
- Must have at least some defined infosec roles/responsibilities beyond general awareness and demonstrate training for those duties

**DOD Mandatory CUI Training as Only Source:**
- "The DoD 'Mandatory' training is fine, but it does not cover everything it needs to. It doesn't tell your employees who to report incidents to in your organization, it doesn't tell them how to handle CUI in your environment, it doesn't tell them what their roles and responsibilities are, etc." - Uncouth (CCP)
- DOD training alone fails because it does not address organization-specific activities, policies, standards, procedures

**Third-Party Training Only (No Organizational Context):**
- "Most companies setup a 3rd party training program and they are done (and Pass assessment?)" - This was raised as a concern
- Need company-specific training on roles, responsibilities, and procedures in addition to generic third-party training

**Rejected Evidence Approach:**
- "If they sucked at being a system admin, we wouldn't have hired them." Evidence? Pile of resumes from people we did not hire." - This received a "blobno" (rejection) reaction from Lead CCA Glenda R. Snodgrass
- HR hiring practices alone do not constitute training evidence

## Over-engineering

**Requiring Proof of Completion When Not Explicitly Required:**
- "The proof of completion is a standard government security audit practice. It is NOT however part of the assessment objectives and I would argue that Not Met for a lack of completion proof is an over reach." - Spock67 (CCA/Technology Vendor)
- Debate exists on whether formal completion certificates are truly required vs. being common practice

**Certs with CPE Requirements for Everyone:**
- For small businesses where staff don't have certifications, requiring formal certs with continuing education may be excessive
- Can use simpler training methods like CDSE courses or internal training with documented completion

## Edge Cases

**Janitorial/Third-Party Facility Staff:**
Discussion around whether third-party janitorial staff in rented spaces require information security training:

- **Position 1 (CUIbert - C3PAO/CCA):** "Janitorial staff shouldn't need to have any information security training - their duties include cleaning the facility and perhaps restocking. Janitors do not have any information security related duties. However, they may need to have training on facility security (do not let others in behind you, wear a badge, etc.)."

- **Position 2 (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):** "Maintaining perimeter security at entry/exit points sounds like an information security-related duty. Janitors might not be guards, but they're still contributing to a secure outcome."

- **Position 3 (MonkSecurity - CCP):** "Janitors need to know what to do if they see CUI in trash cans or happen across it in a printer room or just happen to walk into an office with an un-locked screen... all unescorted personnel are CUI assets and have IS duties. Unless you want to escort your janitors."

- **Resolution:** Depends on scoping. If other controls ensure CUI is not accessible (clean desk when janitors present, locked server rooms, BitLocker encrypted endpoints in locked state, CUI only on specific servers), janitors may not qualify as having "access to organizational systems containing CUI." Scoping decisions drive the industry outcome.

**Infosec Personnel vs. All CUI Users:**
- Question raised: Is 3.2.2 focused on personnel with infosec-specific roles (sysadmin, CISO) OR all personnel who access CUI?
- Answer: "Whether A or B is for you to define based on who you decide are infosec personnel. I define that all personnel have some infosec responsibilities including reporting things to security." - Spock67 (CCA)
- General awareness training covers all-hands requirements, but additional role-specific training needed for infosec roles

**Using Existing Certifications as Training Evidence:**
- If personnel already hold certifications (Security+, etc.), these can be defined as the training requirement
- Certs with CPE requirements help demonstrate currency
- "A cert 15 years ago doesn't necessarily mean you know how to securely configure a modern network, or implement ZTA" - Lead CCA questioning certs without recent CE

## Evidence Examples

**Accepted/Validated:**
- Excel matrix tracking roles, required training, completion dates, and personnel assignments
- Stored certification documents for personnel with security certifications
- Signature forms confirming staff received and reviewed policies, procedures, and training materials for their roles
- Training material lists by system component (Firewall: XYZ doc/video, Windows Server: ABC doc/video)
- LMS/HRIS integrated training completion records
- CDSE (Center for Development of Security Excellence) course completions

**Debated:**
- Formal proof of completion certificates (some assessors view as required, others as overreach)

## Key Quotes

**On OSC Power to Define Training:**
> "This is my philosophy throughout really. Use the power of definition that has been given to me as the OSC to set the bar low, and in a way that I can easily provide evidence." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On Training Flexibility:**
> "It doesn't have to be a cert. It can be conferences or college classes or online learning modules. Most anything. If you use a cert tho you need CE in order to keep it current." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On Organization-Specific Training:**
> "You also want some training on what specific things they have to do for you. Not just general security knowledge." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On Janitorial Staff Scope:**
> "I'm having trouble seeing this as realistic if you're renting space in a building with existing janitorial services. If the control is asking for us to define the roles, responsibilities, and duties, and we leave out some type of janitorial role (finding CUI in the garbage) - I don't think an assessor will count that off as long as what *is* defined is assigned to appropriate personnel who are adequately trained." - CUIbert (C3PAO/CCA)

**On Scoping Impact:**
> "Like everything scoping is everything. How C3PAOs work with clients on scoping will drive the industry." - MonkSecurity (CCP)

**On Proof of Completion:**
> "Right that's what my small clients do and require proof of completion. Even if it's just an email saying 'just finished!' When the training doesn't provide anything at the end." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On Trending Not Met:**
> "I expect some other infosec roles and responsibilities (even for small companies at least one) and some demonstration that they have been trained in those duties. You have a lot of flex in how you do that but give the assessor something there or trending Not Met." - Spock67 (CCA)
