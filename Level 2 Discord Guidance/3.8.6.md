# 3.8.6 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of CUI stored on digital media during transport unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.6[a]: The confidentiality of CUI stored on digital media is protected during transport using cryptographic mechanisms or alternative physical safeguards.

---

## Sufficient

- **FIPS-validated hardware-encrypted USB drives**: Apricorn USB keys are recommended by experts as they work across Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms and use hardware-level encryption that presents as a standard filesystem once decrypted.
- **Hardware-level encryption devices**: Devices like Apricorn work on any system (including printers) because "once decrypted it's just a filesystem like any other device" (Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **Alternative physical safeguards**: Transport via locked cases by guards to secure facilities with secure storage is acceptable as an alternative to cryptographic mechanisms.
- **On-premises LAN transfers within physical perimeter**: Inside your physical perimeter, encryption is not strictly required but is recommended. Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor): "Inside your physical perimeter it does not have to be encrypted. But should be."
- **Protocol-level encryption for file shares**: Samba/CIFS transfers are "probably encrypted in transit at the protocol level" and if server/client are in FIPS mode, the encryption is likely FIPS-validated.
- **Windows FIPS mode for storage**: Storing backups on a Windows server running in FIPS mode can satisfy the "store" requirement, but transmission must also be addressed.

---

## Insufficient

- **Non-FIPS validated encryption without physical safeguards**: A backup solution that encrypts without FIPS validation does not meet the cryptographic requirement - must rely on alternative physical safeguards or ensure storage/transmission uses FIPS-validated mechanisms.
- **Kingston IronKey S1000 on Linux**: Kingston does not recommend their S1000 for Linux, and engineers have had inconsistent results getting it to work.
- **Kanguru software-based solutions**: While Kanguru supports Linux, it is software-based rather than hardware-based encryption (noted by Uncouth, CCP/Fellow).
- **Applications without encryption capability**: Some applications like SolidWorks vaults do not have encryption capabilities built-in, requiring encryption at another layer (protocol or OS level).

## Over-engineering

## Edge Cases

- **Linux + Windows cross-platform encrypted USB**: Finding FIPS-validated encrypted USB devices that work reliably on both Linux and Windows is challenging. Kingston devices with pending FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certification (IronKey D500S, Keypad 200) claim Linux support but are not yet NIST certified.
- **Wireless transfers with CUI**: If wireless is involved and base traffic is unencrypted CUI, the wireless router must be FIPS capable and FIPS configured/operating (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor).
- **FIPS-encrypted media labeling**: There is ongoing debate about whether FIPS-encrypted devices containing CUI should still be labeled as CUI. DoD position has evolved - previously FIPS encryption meant data was no longer a CUI asset, but more recently DoD has stated "it's still CUI."
- **Revision 3 implications**: Current allowance for alternative physical safeguards may not be available when transitioning to Revision 3. Per Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA/Certified CMMC Assessor): "That's okay for now, but understand it won't be an option when we switch to r3."

## Evidence Examples

- FIPS validation certificates for encrypted USB devices (Apricorn, Kingston IronKey)
- Screenshots/documentation of Windows FIPS mode configuration on servers
- Physical security procedures for media transport (locked cases, guard protocols)
- Secure storage facility documentation and access controls
- Network diagrams showing encrypted protocols (SMB/CIFS with encryption)
- Backup solution configuration showing encryption settings and transmission methods

> "Apricorn USB keys are what I've recommended to clients in the past." - **scotty, CCP** (Certified CMMC Professional)

> "yeah something hardware-level like Apricorn should be what you want. it'll even work on a printer... because once decrypted it's just a filesystem like any other device" - **Uncouth, CCP** (Fellow, Certified CMMC Professional)

> "I use my Apricorn on Linux and Mac with no problems. Clients also use them on Windows." - **Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA** (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "Inside your physical perimeter it does not have to be encrypted. But should be. Actually most file manager file transfer is encrypted using TLS. Also if you have wireless then if that base traffic is unencrypted CUI then the wireless router needs to be FIPS capable and FIPS configured/operating." - **Spock67** (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "I think that would cover 'store' so next I would look at 'transmit' -- how do the backups get to the Windows server running in FIPS mode?" - **Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA** (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "If that transmission isn't FIPS, then you are relying on alternative physical safeguards to protect the CUI in transit. That's okay for now, but understand it won't be an option when we switch to r3." - **Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA** (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "[On alternative physical safeguards - does a knife count?] Only if used by a guard." - **rybo** (Moderator, Fellow)
