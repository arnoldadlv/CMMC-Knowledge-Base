# 3.13.16 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest.

**Rev 3 Updated Language:** "Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission and while in storage."

---

## Sufficient

- **Encryption OR Physical Protection:** The control allows for either encryption or physical protections to satisfy the requirement. Encryption is not the only acceptable mechanism.
  - "This requirement only wants to make sure that at rest, CUI confidentiality is protected. Encryption can be one answer. Physical protections can be another" - Uncouth, CCP (Fellow)

- **Non-Mobile Devices with Physical Security:** Devices that remain within PE-controlled areas can rely on physical security alone.
  - "Encryption only required for mobile devices and mobile computing platforms. So non mobile things can rely on physical security." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

- **CRMA Devices via Administrative Controls:** For CRMA (CUI assets that only process/transmit but don't store CUI), administrative controls ensuring CUI never resides at rest are sufficient.
  - "The confidentiality of CUI at rest is protected by ensuring through administrative controls that CUI never resides on this CRMA." - Uncouth, CCP

## Insufficient

No discussion found.

## Over-engineering

- **Encrypting CRMA devices:** CRMA devices do not require encryption for this control because by definition they should not have CUI at rest.
  - Q: "Do I need to encrypt CRMA devices?"
  - A: "Not specifically. There should be no CUI at rest on the CRMA. If there is, then it's not CRMA" - Uncouth, CCP

- **FIPS encryption for non-CUI devices:** FIPS-validated encryption is not required for devices that don't store CUI.
  - "And even if we encrypt, FIPS isn't required for non-CUI." - Michael (Consultant)

---

## Edge Cases

- **Work-From-Home (WFH) Employees:** Devices used by WFH employees, where physical controls are reduced, require cryptographic protection.
  - Q: "Does anyone have thoughts on whether cryptographic protection for data at rest would be a hard requirement for WFH employees where there should be less physical control of the environment expected?"
  - A: "Cryptographic Protection is required any time a device leaves the area protected by PE controls" - MonkSecurity, CCP
  - Related control: 3.8.6 covers portable storage encryption requirements

- **Mobile Devices and Mobile Computing Platforms:** These explicitly require encryption per 3.1.19[b].
  - "3.1.19 [b] encryption is employed to protect CUI on identified mobile devices and mobile computing platforms." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

- **SaaS/ESP Model Ambiguity:** NIST 800-171 Rev 2 assumes on-prem with VPN. The standard doesn't clearly address scenarios like FIPS-encrypted backups in a SaaS environment.
  - "An underlying problem is that NIST 800-171 rev2 assumes an on-prem model with VPN access for remote. It doesn't take into account a SAAS/ESP model, leading to discussions like what to do if FIPS encrypted backups are in a SAAS." - MonkSecurity, CCP

## Evidence Examples

No specific evidence examples discussed. However, the discussion implies:
- For encrypted solutions: Encryption configuration/policy documentation
- For physical-only protection: PE control documentation showing devices remain in protected areas
- For CRMA: Administrative controls/policies documenting that CUI is never stored at rest

## Related Controls Mentioned

- **3.13.8:** Alternative physical safeguards language; transmission protection
- **3.8.6:** Portable media encryption requirements (when devices leave PE-controlled areas)
- **3.1.19:** Mobile device encryption requirement (assessment objective [b])

## Regulatory Evolution Note

800-171 Rev. 3 changes the requirement language to explicitly require cryptographic mechanisms: "Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI during transmission and while in storage." This may remove the physical-protection-only option in future assessments.
