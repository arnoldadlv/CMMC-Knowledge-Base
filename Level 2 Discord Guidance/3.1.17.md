# 3.1.17 - Expertise Overlay
**Control:** Protect wireless access using authentication and encryption.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.17[a] wireless access to the system is protected using authentication.
- 3.1.17[b] wireless access to the system is protected using encryption.

---

## Sufficient

1. **Certificate-based device authentication with domain user login:** Using domain controller-issued certificates for device authentication (replacing MAC address filtering), combined with users authenticating via unique AD credentials before accessing network resources. Self-define authentication as "a member of the domain" and document in SSP accordingly. (Jake/Fellow, rybo/Moderator)

2. **WPA2 Enterprise with proper documentation:** "The wireless network is protected via authentication and encryption. WPA2 Enterprise is currently used to protect wireless traffic. All traffic is fully encrypted. Only authorized users and devices have wireless access." - Likely sufficient, but must also document how encryption meets FIPS requirements. (Jake/Fellow)

3. **FIPS encryption at higher layers bypasses WiFi FIPS requirement:** If CUI traffic is already encrypted via FIPS-validated means (e.g., FIPS VPN, GCCH/Azure Gov services, HTTPS with validated module, SMB3 with FIPS mode), WiFi itself does not need to be FIPS-validated. The encryption at the transport layer satisfies the requirement. (Uncouth/CCP, JB)

4. **Windows file share with FIPS mode SMB3 signing:** If accessing CUI via Windows server file share in FIPS mode with forced SMB3 signing, WiFi encryption at the wireless layer is secondary - the SMB-level encryption covers CUI protection. (Uncouth/CCP confirmed)

5. **Cloud-only architecture (GCCH):** For cloud-based environments accessing only GCCH, where CUI transmission is already FIPS-encrypted by the cloud service, local WiFi FIPS validation is not required.

---

## Insufficient

1. **Ubiquiti/Unifi alone for CUI environments:** "TLDR Unifi is not good enough" when WiFi is the only encryption layer for CUI traffic. Unifi does not provide FIPS-validated encryption. (JB, confirmed with reaction)

2. **WPA2/3-Enterprise with EAP-TLS alone:** "WPA2/3-Enterprise with EAP-TLS is a great way to meet the requirements of this specific control, but it does not change the encryptors in your link. It's a more secure way to establish session keys, not an answer to the FIPS requirement." (JB)

3. **CUI on file server accessed via non-FIPS WiFi:** "If we have CUI data on a File server and that is not encrypted (other than bitlocker at rest) and someone is using Wifi to access it then that becomes an issue." (Uncouth/CCP confirmed)

---

## Over-engineering

1. **MAC address filtering combined with cert-based auth:** Moving from MAC address allow lists to certificate-based device authentication is an improvement, not over-engineering. The original setup (MAC filtering + AD group membership + username/password auth at WiFi connection) was more complex than necessary.

2. **Requiring FIPS WiFi when higher-layer encryption exists:** If all CUI traffic traverses FIPS-validated encryption (VPN, GCCH, SMB3 FIPS mode), requiring FIPS WiFi on top is unnecessary for compliance.

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Work-from-home users on personal WiFi connecting to GCCH:** Not an issue if accessing only GCCH, since GCCH provides FIPS-validated encryption. "Wifi only needs to be FIPS-validated-encryption if it is responsible for the confidentiality of FIPS." The question is whether another layer (VPN, cloud service) handles encryption.

2. **Cloud-only with endpoints as boundary:** Question raised about marking N/A when OSC is cloud-based (GCCH) with only endpoints in scope, scoping out LANs entirely. Expert response: "I never do N/A. Explain why it is met by having no wireless access in the data center." Avoid N/A - instead document how the control is satisfied.

3. **Multiple CUI data flows:** "It's probably not [your only CUI-carrying data flow], so just carry that logic through for any data flow that does involve CUI (email, etc.)." Must analyze ALL CUI data flows, not just primary ones.

4. **Wireless as boundary exit:** "It would be hard to argue that wireless is *not* leaving your boundary, so it needs at least one layer of FIPS validated encryption to check the box." - Wireless inherently crosses the boundary, requiring FIPS encryption at some layer.

## Evidence Examples

1. **SSP documentation approach:** Document that authentication is achieved through domain membership (users must be authenticated domain users to access domain-joined devices with certificates). Explicitly state how both 3.1.16 (authorize) and 3.1.17 (authenticate + encrypt) are met.

2. **Acceptable evidence scenarios:**
   - WPA2 Enterprise configuration screenshots
   - Certificate-based authentication setup documentation
   - FIPS mode configuration on file servers (for SMB3 encryption)
   - VPN configuration showing FIPS validation
   - GCCH/Azure Gov SRMs demonstrating FIPS encryption

3. **Data flow documentation:** "This is where understanding your real CUI data and dataflows can be helpful." - Document CUI data flows showing where encryption occurs at each hop.

## Key Quotes

> "There's no definition for what is required to 'authenticate'. So if you self-define authentication as 'a member of the domain' then IMO you should be fine" - Jake/Fellow

> "I never do N/A. Explain why it is met by having no wireless access in the data center" - Jake/Fellow

> "Likely. You'll have to discuss how the encryption is FIPS" - Jake/Fellow (on WPA2 Enterprise sufficiency)

> "Wifi only needs to be FIPS-validated-encryption if it is responsible for the confidentiality of FIPS. In other words, do you users already run a FIPS VPN? Or do they only access services (i.e., GCCH) that are themselves already FIPS Validated? Wifi comes in to play if you have to encrypt at that transport layer because your traffic isn't encrypted at some other, higher layer." - Uncouth/CCP

> "This is where understanding your real CUI data and dataflows can be helpful." - Uncouth/CCP

> "WPA2/3-Enterprise with EAP-TLS is a great way to meet the requirements of this specific control, but it does not change the encryptors in your link. It's a more secure way to establish session keys, not an answer to the FIPS requirement." - JB

> "By itself, it's not. If you encrypt everything at higher layers (e.g. HTTPS) with a validated module, you can use Unifi." - JB

> "The argument from a compliance standpoint is that you need FIPS encryption for any CUI which exits your boundary. It would be hard to argue that wireless is *not* leaving your boundary, so it needs at least one layer of FIPS validated encryption to check the box." - JB

> "From a security standpoint, many WiFi deployments are alarmingly insecure, so going above and beyond at higher layers for anything which traverses WiFi is still a good idea." - JB

## Related Controls
- **3.1.16** - Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections (discussed in context of domain group limiting WiFi access)
- **3.13.x** - FIPS encryption requirements (heavily interrelated - wireless encryption requirements depend on CUI data flow encryption at other layers)
