# 3.13.12 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and provide indication of devices in use to users present at the device.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.13.12[a] collaborative computing devices are identified
- 3.13.12[b] collaborative computing devices provide indication to users of devices in use
- 3.13.12[c] remote activation of collaborative computing devices is prohibited

---

## Sufficient

- **Physical camera covers/sliders acceptable:** A Lead CCA (Glenda R. Snodgrass) confirmed that webcam covers, laptop cam sliders, or even "a piece of black tape" are acceptable for meeting objective [c] to prohibit remote activation.

- **Conference systems with visual/audio indicators:** Systems that provide indication when in use (lights, on-screen notifications) satisfy objective [b]. "Our conference systems give an indication when they are on, you can't just connect one and nobody will know" - this covers [c].

- **Requiring call acceptance before activation:** VTC units configured to require someone to accept the call before cameras/mics activate meets the control. "Like a telephone: it can ring, but it's not just going to start listening/turning on cams until someone accepts the call."

- **Disabling auto-accept on conference systems:** Simply configure conference room systems to NOT auto-accept calls - "that's all you'd need to do for that control."

---

## Insufficient

No discussion found explicitly labeling approaches as insufficient.

---

## Over-engineering

- **GPO to disable cameras during RDP sessions:** One user asked about using GPO to turn off cameras when connected through RDP. The implication from discussion was this may be overkill - the "big risk" is conference room systems that auto-accept calls, not necessarily end-user devices.

- **VLAN isolation for conference room devices:** A user asked if isolating devices with cameras/mics on their own VLAN would prevent remote activation. The response indicated this is unnecessary complexity when simply configuring the device to require call acceptance would suffice.

---

## Edge Cases

- **Laptop webcams and integrated microphones:** Question raised whether this control applies to laptop-integrated cameras/mics or just conference room systems. The Assessment Guide discusses "ones attached to the system" (per Further Discussion section), but both 800-171 and 800-53 are described as "vague" on this point. The AG discussion section "could be read like it's only concerned with the cameras and microphones deployed in areas like conference rooms."

- **Remote support tools (TeamViewer, Ninja Remote):** Scenario raised: admin remotes into user's computer and opens Camera app. Expert response: "I would simply not define that as a collaborative computing *device* - that's just remote support/remote access." However, recommendation given: "end user likely needs to accept the remote access, if not, you might want to think about forcing that."

- **Remote support with user interaction requirement:** Read as potentially requiring "a warning + user interaction if you're using a remote support system" - though this interpretation was not explicitly confirmed or denied by assessors.

## Evidence Examples

- **Conference room system configuration:** Screenshots or settings showing devices require manual call acceptance before activating cameras/microphones
- **Hardware indicators:** Documentation that cameras have indicator lights (satisfies [b])
- **Physical controls:** Photos of webcam covers, camera sliders, or physical covers on devices
- **Inventory of collaborative computing devices:** List identifying all in-scope devices with cameras/microphones (satisfies [a])
- **Polycom or similar VTC device settings:** Configuration showing auto-accept is disabled

## Discussion Gaps

- **Pass/fail scenarios:** No explicit pass/fail assessment scenarios were discussed
- **Microphone-specific controls:** Discussions focused primarily on cameras; less clarity on microphone-only scenarios
- **Smart speakers/IoT devices:** Not discussed whether Alexa, Google Home, or similar devices in scope
- **Mobile devices:** No discussion of smartphone/tablet cameras in conference rooms
