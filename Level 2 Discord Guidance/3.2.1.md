# 3.2.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Ensure that managers, systems administrators, and users of organizational systems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of those systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- [a] security risks associated with organizational activities involving CUI are identified
- [b] policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of the system are identified
- [c] managers, systems administrators, and users of the system are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities
- [d] managers, systems administrators, and users of the system are made aware of the applicable policies, standards, and procedures related to the security of the system

## Sufficient

- **DoD CDSE training as a COMPONENT, combined with organization-specific training** - DoD training (CUI training, Cybersecurity Awareness, Insider Threat) can be used as part of training requirements, but must be supplemented with OSC-specific policies and procedures training
- **Simple slide deck (even 3 pages) covering OSC-specific content** - Acceptable if it covers: (1) where policies and procedures are located, (2) security POC contact information, (3) acknowledgment/signature requirement
- **Employee handbook with AUP included, signed annually** - Acceptable when AUP is embedded and employees sign
- **Separate AUP signed by users** - Breaking AUP out of handbook and having employees sign both documents
- **Azure AD Terms of Use feature as conditional access policy** - Upload AUP/ISUA, require consent at login and annually thereafter, tracks consent in Azure AD
- **Email with poll/acknowledgment function** requiring user affirmation (read/acknowledged/agreed)
- **Interview verification** - If users can articulate policies, procedures, and where to find them during interview, can pass as MET
- **Training completion records** - PDF certificates of completion stored in repository, reports from training systems showing completion

---

## Insufficient

- **DoD CDSE training ALONE** - Generic government training will NOT satisfy [b] and [d] because it does not cover the OSC's specific policies, standards, and procedures
- **Generic cyber awareness training only** - Must include organization-specific content
- **Plain email without acknowledgment mechanism** - "Emails would be too easy to ignore" - need some form of affirmation
- **IT department signing attestation** - Questionable authority; IT department typically does not have authority to direct all employees. CEO signature would be more appropriate. Assessor may dig to determine if this is substantive or just paperwork.
- **Training that only covers generic DoD content** - Does not achieve [d] which requires awareness of OSC-specific policies, standards, and procedures

## Edge Cases

### GFE (Government Furnished Equipment) Users
- **GFE managed by government is likely out of scope** - Owned/operated by government, included in their SSP for ATO under 800-53
- **Users on government-owned systems get their training from the government** - 800-171 user training for government owned systems is out of scope
- **If GFE-only users do not access contractor system CUI** - Can be considered out of scope for OSC training requirements
- **Users with both GFE and contractor accounts** - If contractor accounts are logically separated from CUI on contractor system via permissions (SharePoint, firewall, etc.), may qualify as CRMA rather than full in-scope
- **CRMA vs OOS for separated users** - Signing AUP even for logically-separated users provides "assessor risk mitigation" against contrary assessors

### One-Time Training vs Annual
- **No annual requirement explicitly stated in [b] and [d]** - "Are made aware of" does not specify frequency
- **Annual preference** - Assessors prefer annual affirmation, but one-time may technically meet minimum bar
- **One-time shows low due diligence** - Though technically defensible, opens door to assessor challenge

### Standards as Documents
- **Not required to have separate "standards" documents** - Control requires training on policies, standards, AND procedures, but can embed standard-type info in SSP or procedures
- **Governance document list is key** - Must be able to identify what your governance documents are for the system

### Scope of Training Applicability
- **Applies to all users of "the system"** - Not just CUI users; includes managers, systems administrators, and users who touch the system

## Evidence Examples

- **Training completion certificates (PDF)** stored in repository
- **LMS/Training system reports** showing completion by user
- **Signed employee handbook** containing AUP and security policies
- **Signed Acceptable Use Policy** (separate document)
- **Azure AD Terms of Use consent records** (Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access > Terms of Use)
- **Email acknowledgment records** with poll/affirmation responses
- **Privileged user agreement** signed by domain admins (separate from general AUP)
- **Slide deck or brief training materials** covering OSC-specific policies/procedures with signed acknowledgment

## Key Quotes

> "I think it is appropriate to use the government training as a component of training requirements but not sufficient if it is the only training the OSC has. I'll accept here's the PowerPoint slide of unique OSC policy stuff that employees have to sign and return as acceptable though" - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "DoD training won't achieve [b] and [d], has to be specific, and like I said I'll accept a slide show even if its only like 3 pages long and just says hey go here for the policies & procedures, and here's the contact information for security POCs, and slide 3 is hey acknowledge and sign here" - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "If you are interviewing users and they can't tell you the proper way to protect CUI or how to send / receive it according to policy, it is time to dig in further though" - Amira Armond (C3PAO, Fellow)

> "An assessor is not going to sit through your hour long training" - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "Through interview, if users are aware of the policy and procedures and where they are, I would pass that as Met though" - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "The problem with [d] where people get a Not Met is that they make everyone take DoD CUI training, or a generic Cyber training and call it good. Does not meet the assessment objective requirement. Not Met." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, Consultant)

> "I would be cautious here. Does the IT department have the authority to direct all employees to take the training and follow the policies and procedures? Probably not which would probably have me as an assessor digging a little bit to understand whether or not that is actually a thing, or you just created a piece of paper to make me happy." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, Consultant)

> "We put acceptable use into the employee handbook and then sign. We then have a separate one for priviledged users (defined as domain admins) that they sign. There is no direct requirement for employee signatures. You have to provide evidence to satisfy the related assessment objectives. Signatures are great evidence though." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, Consultant)

> "I might allow myself to be persuaded that they met the objective of training with something other than training... particularly if it is a small company and the people I am talking to know what the right answers are. As a Consultant though I am advising that you need training that talks to your policies and procedures, not just the generic stuff from DoD. I think that leaves you at risk" - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, Consultant)

> "800-171 user training for government owned systems is out of scope" - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)
