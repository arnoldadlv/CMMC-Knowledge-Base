# 3.13.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.13.5[a] publicly accessible system components are identified.
- 3.13.5[b] subnetworks for publicly accessible system components are physically or logically separated from internal networks.

## Sufficient

### Logical Separation Methods (Accepted)
- **Firewall zones with explicit allow rules**: VPN in a separate zone (e.g., "sslvpn") where access to LAN is denied by default and only allowed by exception is considered logical separation
- **Cloud separation**: Systems in cloud environments (e.g., GCC-High) are inherently separated from on-premises internal networks - "By having a system in the cloud it is pretty definitively separated from other parts of the system" (Spock67, CCA)
- **Entra ID/Azure AD with Conditional Access**: GCC-High sign-in page logically separated by authentication layer - users must go through Entra ID before accessing resources
- **Separate subnets for VPN users**: Fortigate VPN assigning different IPs in a separate subnet, requiring firewall rules to access other subnets
- **WAN IPs on firewall**: Logically separated from the internal network
- **Software-defined networking/VPCs**: FedRAMP JAB recognizes software gateways with access rules as valid logical separation

### Key FedRAMP Definitions (Referenced)
- **Publicly accessible**: "The first compute instance that can be accessed from outside the boundary. These components often handle tasks such as authentication, or delivering the first data back to a destination outside the boundary."
- **Subnet**: "A physically or logically segmented section of a larger network defined at TCP/IP Layer 3 to both minimize traffic and add a crucial layer of network isolation."

## Insufficient

### Rejected or Questionable Approaches
- **ACL alone without network separation**: "I always think of this one as the DMZ requirement. I dont think an ACL would do it." (Spock67, CCA) - received endorsement reactions
- **MFA/device authentication as sole control**: Question raised whether device authentication and MFA alone satisfy the control - discussion indicates the control requires network-level separation, not just access control

### Common Misunderstandings
- **Conflating "publicly facing" with "publicly accessible"**: Components requiring credentials to access are considered "public-facing" but are still "publicly accessible" if the login page/entry point can be reached without authentication
- **VPN login vs VPN itself**: "I was not aware that publicly accessible also meant components which require user and device authentication. I thought the vpn login is 'publicly facing' but the vpn itself is not 'publicly accessible'" - this was a corrected misconception

## Over-engineering

### Situations Where Simpler Approaches Work
- **Cloud-only environments with no on-prem servers**: If using GCC-High with no internal email server or web server, the cloud platform provides inherent separation - may not require additional DMZ infrastructure
- **Out-of-scope websites**: Static websites hosted by third parties on separate networks can be noted as OOS while still demonstrating physical/logical separation
- **Assessor note on complexity risk**: "An isolated network is way, way easier to assess because most people understand it! We shouldn't lose sight of the audit risks associated with bleeding edge tech that very few people understand." (rybo, Moderator) - suggests keeping it simple for easier assessment

## Edge Cases

### VPN as Publicly Accessible Component
- **Consensus**: VPN is a publicly accessible system component - "is a vpn a publicly accessible system component? yes." (Uncouth, CCP)
- **VPN must have paths to both networks**: "without some crazy engineering the VPN will necessarily have to have paths to both networks. that's why they're also so risky" (Uncouth)

### VoIP Phone Systems
- **Question raised**: "Does a VoIP phone system count as publicly accessible since anyone with a phone can call in?" (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- **No conclusion found**: This question was asked but no definitive answer was provided in the discussion

### GCC-High/Azure Login Page
- **Question raised**: Whether Azure GCCH Login page is a publicly accessible system to list in SSP
- **Not inherited from FedRAMP**: "I dont know that I would call it inherited" (Spock67, CCA) - cloud system separation is inherent but OSC still needs to document
- **Conditional Access as separation mechanism**: Sign-in page separated by Entra ID authentication layer

### Exchange Server with OWA Disabled
- **Question raised**: "A mail (Exchange) server with OWA disabled, and Outlook requires a VPN connection; is that sufficient?"
- **No conclusion found**: Question asked but not answered in the discussion

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Documentation
- Network diagrams showing separate zones/subnets for public-facing components
- Firewall configuration showing VPN in separate zone with explicit allow rules to LAN
- Cloud architecture showing Entra ID/Conditional Access configuration
- Screenshots of firewall rules demonstrating default-deny from VPN zone to LAN

### Referenced Guidance Documents
- Microsoft CMMC Level 1 Implementation Guide
- Microsoft Product Placemat for Level 2
- Microsoft Technical Reference Guide for Level 2
- NIST SP 800-41 (Firewall guidance)
- NIST SP 800-125B (Secure Virtual Network Configuration)
- NIST SP 800-77 (VPN guidance)
- NIST SP 800-189 (Address spoofing prevention)

## Key Quotes

### Definition Clarifications

> "The 'publicly accessible' parts of a public facing system are the elements (i.e., logon page) that are accessible without credentials. Everything that's only accessible with credentials is not publicly accessible."
> - rybo (Moderator)

> "The problem here is that 'subnetworks' is an old way of determining separation. A system resource doesn't need to be on its own network in order to be segmented. ACLs can do the job."
> - rybo (Moderator)

> "It's yet another instance of older documentation not properly describing/addressing modern technologies. That's when we have to look at the intent of the control, and ACLs satisfy the intent IMO."
> - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

### FedRAMP JAB Guidance (cited by rybo)

> "What constitutes 'publicly accessible' is sometimes misunderstood. The Joint Authorization Board (JAB) considers the term 'publicly accessible' to include the first compute instance that can be accessed from outside the boundary."

> "Software-defined networking has potential to introduce disruptive changes... software gateways define the access rules, and can be assigned to a VPC, subnet, or even an individual interface."

### Practical Implementation

> "It is not a good security engineering principle to put your public-facing things on the same subnetwork as your internal LAN"
> - Uncouth (CCP, Fellow)

> "The WAN IPs on a firewall are logically separated from the internal network."
> - volfman

> "By needing to go through Entra ID to get to anything the sign-in page is separated from resources."
> - Kips

### Assessment Perspective

> "I'm in complete agreement that an isolated network is way, way easier to assess because most people understand it! We shouldn't lose sight of the audit risks associated with bleeding edge tech that very few people understand."
> - rybo (Moderator)

> "This is the DMZ control really. By having a system in the cloud it is pretty definitively separated from other parts of the system."
> - Spock67 (CCA)

## Unresolved Questions

1. **VoIP phone systems**: Does a VoIP system count as publicly accessible? (Asked by Lead CCA, no answer)
2. **Exchange server behind VPN**: Is disabling OWA and requiring VPN for Outlook sufficient? (No answer)
3. **ACL vs DMZ debate**: Some disagreement exists - rybo/Glenda say ACLs can satisfy intent; Spock67 says "I dont think an ACL would do it"
