# 3.3.3 - Expertise Overlay
## Review and update logged events

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.3.3[a] A process for determining when to review logged events is defined
- 3.3.3[b] Event types being logged are reviewed in accordance with the defined review process
- 3.3.3[c] Event types being logged are updated based on the review

**DoD CAC Ranking:** #6 most commonly failed requirement (per Amira Armond)

---

## Sufficient

- **Defined review process with periodic cadence** - At minimum annually, review whether current logs are sufficient to meet security needs (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **Work log or change ticket** showing logging settings were modified to increase true detections or reduce false alarms (Amira Armond, C3PAO)
- **Meeting minutes** documenting the periodic review event, even if no changes were made (Spock67)
- **Microsoft documentation** showing what M365 unified audit logs and Defender for Endpoint collect, combined with documented periodic review that these meet organizational needs (socketsetter, Certified CMMC Assessor; Spock67)
- **Evidence of updates to baseline configurations** (e.g., group policy, MDM) after identifying logging gaps (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

---

## Insufficient

- **Claiming N/A** for cloud-managed systems like M365/Defender for Endpoint - "Do NOT try to say NA to an assessor. That would be Not Met." (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **No documented review process** - The control requires a PROCESS for determining WHEN to review, not just having logs configured
- **Arguing "we already have all logs configured and we're happy"** - May work but is risky; better to demonstrate some improvement effort (Amira Armond)
- **Just having logging enabled** - This is a common misunderstanding; the control is about reviewing WHICH events SHOULD be logged, not just that logging exists

## Edge Cases

### M365/Defender for Endpoint Environments
- **Question:** Does 3.3.3 apply when using M365 unified audit log and Defender for Endpoint, since you cannot modify what logs are collected? (lombo617, CCP)
- **Answer:** YES, it still applies. Options include:
  - Add SIEM endpoint agent or EDR tool to supplement
  - Consume Windows event logs in additional systems
  - At minimum: Document periodic review that existing vendor-provided logging meets security requirements
  - Provide Microsoft documentation showing log capabilities, tied to 3.3.1[a] requirements (socketsetter, Certified CMMC Assessor)

### No Changes Needed After Review
- If review determines current logging is adequate, document the review event itself with meeting minutes or similar evidence
- Still need to show the PROCESS was followed even if outcome was "no changes needed"

---

## Evidence Examples

**Acceptable evidence discussed:**
- Work logs showing logging configuration changes
- Change tickets for logging setting modifications
- Meeting minutes from periodic log review sessions
- Microsoft documentation on M365 audit log / Defender for Endpoint capabilities
- Group Policy or MDM configuration push records showing new logging settings applied
- Baseline configuration update records

**Specific logging improvements mentioned:**
- Adding logging for external hard drive connections
- Adding logging for software installation
- Enabling Windows Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4625 (failed logon)
- Adjustments after security incidents to capture previously unlogged attack vectors

## Key Quotes

> "This requirement is another example of misunderstanding == failing (alongside the other top 10 requirements). Most people do not understand what is expected for 3.3.3."
> -- Amira Armond, C3PAO (CMMCAudit.org)

> "Show that you are doing 3.3.3 Review and update logged events by providing a work log or change ticket as proof that you modified logging settings to increase true detections or to reduce false alarms."
> -- Amira Armond, C3PAO

> "Already have all the logs configured and you're happy with them? You can try making that argument; it will probably work? Or you can brainstorm some way to improve... that will definitely make your assessor happy."
> -- Amira Armond, C3PAO

> "Do NOT try to say NA to an assessor. That would be Not Met. Even with the documentation from Microsoft... you need to periodically (at least annually) review if those logs are sufficient to meet your needs or should have more. Document that event in some way with meeting minutes etc."
> -- Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor/CCP

> "In my review, I identify that we aren't generating logs for Windows event IDs 4624 (successful logon) or 4625 (failed logon). We decide that we should definitely generate those event types... We push the new setting(s) via group policy and MDM. The 'event types being logged are updated' as a result of the review."
> -- rybo, Moderator/Fellow (practical example)
