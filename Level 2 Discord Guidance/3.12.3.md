# 3.12.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.

**Assessment Objective (from discussion):** Determine if security controls are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of those controls.

---

## Sufficient

- **Manual monitoring is acceptable** for small organizations (e.g., 3-person setup) using spreadsheets with pass/fail tracking, as long as you can provide proof you are doing it (Jake/ace_rimmer)
- **Spreadsheet tracking with key fields:** pass/fail status, comments section, date of review, and who performed the review (rafaAmd101 confirmed this approach)
- **Recurring ticketing system tasks** (e.g., Jira monthly maintenance tickets) to monitor controls and document observations - rybo confirmed "This is what we do" and noted the completed ticket with notes is "great evidence"
- **Combining related controls for monitoring:** Using risk assessment (3.11.1), security assessment (3.12.1), and IR plan follow-up actions (3.6) together satisfies ongoing monitoring (Jake/ace_rimmer SSP example)
- **Monitoring high-priority controls on periodic basis** + annual assessment of all 110 controls can result in a "Met" finding (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- **"Ongoing" is an ODV (Organizationally Defined Value)** - organization defines the frequency (Jake/ace_rimmer)
- **Quarterly random testing** of controls mentioned in policy is acceptable (rafaAmd101 approach)
- **FedRAMP ConMon frequencies adapted for 800-171** provide a solid framework - focus on volatile requirements (patching, inventory updates, document drift) more frequently (rybo, Moderator)

## Insufficient

- **SSP and policy stating "we will do it" without proof of execution** - the question "what does an auditor want to see?" indicates policy alone is not enough (armyguy298's initial concern)
- **Monitoring only selected controls while ignoring others** - "pick what controls you'd like to monitor and watch them like a hawk" while ignoring the rest of the 320 AOs was questioned as problematic (Cuipacabra)
- **No documentation of when monitoring occurred** - date field recommended as necessary evidence (Jake/ace_rimmer)

## Over-engineering

- **Assessment Objective Evaluation Plan (AOEP)** covering all 320 AOs with varying frequencies (weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually), plus annual 20% spot-check with 80% threshold triggering full review - Jake responded "Honestly that sounds great" but acknowledged it was "an absolute project" to create (Cuipacabra, CCP)
- **Note:** This elaborate AOEP approach with automated Asana scheduling was described by the implementer as keeping them "from losing site of CMMC" - effective but significantly more than minimum required

## Edge Cases

- **3.12.3 vs 3.12.1 distinction:** L2 assessment guide says monitoring (3.12.3) should occur MORE frequently than assessing (3.12.1). The difference: 3.12.3 is "monitoring to ensure continued effectiveness" while 3.12.1 is "assess to ensure controls are effective in their application" - community noted these "read" similarly (Cuipacabra discussion)
- **High-priority controls only vs. all controls:** Monitoring all controls is "implied" according to Certified CMMC Assessor Spock67, but monitoring only high-priority controls periodically while doing annual full assessment would still likely get a "Met" - though hitting all controls "mitigates some compliance risk"
- **Automation not required:** Control can be satisfied manually; automation is not mandated

## Evidence Examples

- **Completed Jira tickets** with notes documenting monthly monitoring activities (rybo confirmed as "great evidence")
- **Spreadsheet** with columns for: control, pass/fail, comments, date reviewed, reviewer name
- **Dashboards** showing things are monitored (armyguy298 mentioned as potential evidence)
- **FedRAMP-style ConMon checklist** adapted for 800-171 requirements - referenced activities mapped to NIST controls with assigned frequencies (rybo shared image reference)
- **Recurring task completion records** from project management tools (Asana mentioned)
- **Documentation showing link to related controls:** Evidence that 3.11.1 (risk assessment), 3.12.1 (security assessment), and 3.6 (incident response) activities feed into ongoing monitoring

## Key Quotes

> "Yes as long as you can provide proof that you are doing it" - Jake/ace_rimmer (on manual quarterly monitoring)

> "I suggest also a date field showing when you did the review" - Jake/ace_rimmer

> "This is what we do. I would say that the subject of each recurring activity is the more important element. The completed ticket with notes is great evidence, though!" - rybo (Moderator, on Jira recurring tickets)

> "'ongoing' is an ODV (Organizationally Defined Value)." - Jake/ace_rimmer

> "I think that monitoring all controls is implied but would give you a Met for the implementation you describe. It would be better if your periodic process hit all controls at some point in their process I think." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "I think the annual as separate from the continuously is a good thing. So in my implementation I do continuous in a fashion that all not just some controls are hit, and then also do an annual mock assessment that covers everything." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "A big part of continuous monitoring is checking in with some of the more volatile requirements from 800-171 (patching vulns, updating inventories, managing document drift) more frequently. Not a lot of 'new' topics to address." - rybo (Moderator)

> "3.12.3 just basically said 'hey we do the things we say in those controls'" - Jake/ace_rimmer (on relationship between 3.12.3 and 3.11.1/3.12.1)
