# 3.1.12 - Expertise Overlay
## Monitor and control remote access sessions

**Assessment Objectives (per rybo):**
- 3.1.12[a] remote access sessions are permitted
- 3.1.12[b] the types of permitted remote access are identified
- 3.1.12[c] remote access sessions are controlled
- 3.1.12[d] remote access sessions are monitored

### Defining "Remote Access" - The Core Debate
**Critical insight: There is NO assessor consensus on whether VPN connections from company-owned devices constitute "remote access."**

**NIST Definition cited (Spock67, CCA):**
> "Remote = An information exchange between network-connected devices where the information cannot be reliably protected end-to-end by a single organization's security control"

**Alternative NIST definition (Glenda, Lead CCA):**
> "Access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet)"

**Emerging consensus position (scotty, CCP - endorsed by multiple CCAs):**
- The initial VPN handshake/connection FROM laptop TO VPN is remote (untrusted)
- ONCE VPN connection is established, traffic through the tunnel is NOT remote
- Active VPN sessions = not remote; handshake process prior = remote

**Practical guidance (scotty, CCP):**
> "Assessor discretion is a real thing. The best thing you can do is document your stance very clearly and explain it very clearly. If the logic is sound and it is documented very well, I think an assessor will agree."

### What IS Remote Access (accepted examples)
- External-facing portals (dropbox-like) accessed by devices NOT in the environment
- Third-party VPN services (e.g., Citrix cloud VPN)
- Access via the internet to admin portals WITHOUT VPN established first (e.g., Intune, M365 admin)
- Vendor remote maintenance connections (e.g., firewall vendor support)
- Any access using tools like GoToMyPC, Quick Assist from outside the boundary

### Monitoring Requirements
**Per Jeff Baldwin (CCA/RPO):**
> "Monitoring means someone looks at the logs... you would describe your process for monitoring remote access including reviewing those logs and then you would have to provide proof that you actually perform monitoring through a procedure that you follow and any records that you might have when the review is completed, which can come in any form you want, a ticket, an email, whatever, show examples of any of those mentioned alerts."

**Acceptable monitoring evidence discussed:**
- VPN sign-in log reviews
- Email alerts when VPN logons occur
- Review process documentation with proof of execution (tickets, emails, etc.)

### Cloud/SaaS Access (M365, Intune, GWS)
**Per rybo (Moderator):**
> "Anything taking place over the Internet would be considered remote."

**However, scotty noted a caveat:**
- If admin traffic is routed through VPN tunnel first
- AND admin portals only allow traffic from tunneled IP
- THEN admin portion would not be considered remote

**For CSP inheritance (Glenda, Lead CCA):**
> "You inherit how Google permits remote access to its assets by its employees. You control how your people access GWS."

## Insufficient

### Scoping the Control Out Incorrectly
**Cannot scope out just because CUI is not accessed remotely:**
> "Not just CUI data. If remote access is used for system maintenance, for example, I believe this control would still apply." - Glenda, Lead CCA

The control applies if remote access is used for ANY in-scope systems, not just CUI data handling.

### Claiming VPN-over-Internet is "Non-Remote" Without Documentation
**Spock67 (CCA) acknowledged:**
> "That is probably NOT a universal opinion."

Without clear documentation of your interpretation and rationale, claiming VPN as non-remote could fail assessment with a different assessor.

## Edge Cases

### Site-to-Site VPNs
- Generally considered internal systems, NOT remote access
- Discussed but not disputed

### VPN from Company Device
**The major gray area:**
- Company laptop (CUI asset) connecting via VPN to company network
- Some assessors: NOT remote (once tunnel established, part of the system)
- Other assessors: IS remote (data traverses internet)
- **No C3PAO consensus reached** - confirmed by Spock67 (Jan 2025)

### Attended Remote Support Tools (Quick Assist, etc.)
- If access originates from outside the boundary, it falls under 3.1.12
- If access is AFTER VPN connection from a covered device, treated differently

### Intune/M365 Admin Portals from Home
- Direct access over internet = remote access (per rybo)
- Access via VPN tunnel with IP restrictions on admin portals = potentially not remote

### Control Applicability When CUI Not Involved
- Control STILL applies if remote access is used for system maintenance
- Only OOS (Out of Scope) if remote access is restricted to completely OOS functions
- Still need policy explaining the restriction

---

## Evidence Examples

### For Monitoring:
- VPN sign-in logs with evidence of review
- Alerting configuration for VPN logons
- Tickets/emails documenting review completion
- Documented procedure for monitoring with proof of execution

### For Permitted Types:
- Policy identifying approved remote access methods
- Clear documentation of what constitutes "remote" in the organization's context

### For Control:
- TLS 1.2 configuration (mentioned by rybo)
- Domain/device authentication requirements
- FIPS-validated VPN

## Key Quotes

**On the definition challenge (Spock67, CCA):**
> "I think really it is a matter of the concept of how IT is done changing from the early days of computing where everything was on prem and a remote connection was an anomaly. Now everything is remote as defined and the distinction does not work as well in modern zero trust IT architecture. Yet the definition remains and the DoD is stuck with a vision of computing from the 1990s"

**On VPN connection state (scotty, CCP):**
> "The initial connection from the laptop TO the VPN is remote, UNTIL a connection is established. Traffic from the laptop to vpn.company.com is untrusted, then, once the connection is established, you have a secured connection."

> "Active VPN sessions, I'd argue, not remote. The handshake process prior to an established connection, is remote."

**On assessor variability (Spock67, CCA - Jan 2025):**
> "No alignment on this one. Overrun by new rule gray areas"
> "Probably more [assessors] consider [VPN] remote"

**On documentation importance (scotty, CCP):**
> "Just like NIST requirements, don't take something at face value. Break it down and flow it out."

**On monitoring (Jeff Baldwin, CCA):**
> "Monitoring means someone looks at the logs"

**On M365/Cloud (rybo, Moderator):**
> "The connection is remote (SSL/TLS), and the subsequent user session is within the company boundary between two organizationally controlled assets (M365 and the user device). TLS 1.2 and domain/device authentication are some of the ways you're controlling the remote access."

## Practical Recommendation from Discussion

Given the lack of assessor consensus on VPN classification:
1. **Safest approach:** Treat VPN as remote access for assessment purposes
2. Document your interpretation clearly with rationale
3. Be prepared to defend your position with NIST definitions
4. Ensure monitoring and control mechanisms are in place regardless
