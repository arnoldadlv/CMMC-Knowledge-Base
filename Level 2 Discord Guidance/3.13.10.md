# 3.13.10 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Establish and manage cryptographic keys for cryptography employed in organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.13.10[a] cryptographic keys are established whenever cryptography is employed.
- 3.13.10[b] cryptographic keys are managed whenever cryptography is employed.

---

## Sufficient

- **Server-side key management focus:** Control 3.13.10 is about key management "on the server side" - not client-side browser encryption for data in transit (Jake, Fellow)
- **Dual-track key management approach:** Managing keys from both internal Certificate Authority (tracked in CA system) AND external Certificate Authority (IT team manages security and renewal) is acceptable (Jake, Fellow - SSP example)
- **Cloud provider responsibility for SaaS:** For GCC High/SharePoint Online, "Microsoft is managing the keys" - reference their shared responsibility matrix (Jake, Fellow)
- **Backup key separation with access control:** Storing BitLocker keys on SharePoint in an access-controlled site is acceptable IF the backup admin cannot access the data site and vice versa - no single point of failure where compromise gives access to both key and data (Glenda Snodgrass, Lead CCA - confirmed acceptable)

## Insufficient

- **Keys stored with backup data:** Storing encryption keys in the same location as the encrypted backup data is a common failure. "You'd be amazed how often I see this." (Glenda Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- **Single point of failure:** If one compromised account could access both the backed-up data AND the encryption key, that would be insufficient key management (Glenda Snodgrass, Lead CCA - probing question)

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Browser-based encryption for data in transit:** When uploading/downloading CUI via browser to cloud services (e.g., GCC High), the key management responsibility falls to the cloud provider (Microsoft), not the organization. This is distinct from keys the organization directly manages. (Jake, Fellow)
- **FIPS mode on endpoints:** Having FIPS mode enabled on laptops relates to using validated cryptographic modules, but the browser/cloud provider handles the key management for TLS connections during upload/download. (Discussion context)

## Evidence Examples

**SSP Language Example (Jake, Fellow):**
> "[Company] IT manages cryptographic keys in two ways. If the key is provided by an internal Certificate Authority (on either our [internal] or [DMZ] domain), it is tracked in that system. If the key is provided by an external Certificate Authority (such as for public facing services), then the IT team is responsible for managing security of the key and for ensuring that the key is renewed when needed."

**Acceptable BitLocker Key Backup Scenario:**
- Backup laptop is BitLocker encrypted
- BitLocker key stored on SharePoint Online (GCC High) in separate, access-controlled site
- Backup admin has access to key site only
- Backup admin is NOT a member of the data site
- No single account can access both key and encrypted data

**Cloud Service Documentation:**
- Reference Microsoft's shared responsibility matrix for GCC High to document cloud provider key management responsibilities

## Key Quotes

> "3.13.10 is talking about key management like on the server side" - Jake (Fellow)

> "Microsoft is managing the keys... Should be in their shared responsibility matrix" - Jake (Fellow)

> "Be sure you are generating and managing your own keys for encrypted backups, and that the keys aren't getting backed up in the same place as the data. You'd be amazed how often I see this." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "What I'm trying to determine is whether there is a single point of failure that could put the backup and the key together. If the backup admin account on sharepoint is compromised, would the bad guy be able to access both the backed-up data and the key?" - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "No the backup admin can not access the data site. So if the backup admins account is compromised then the hacker may have the key but no access to the data site because the backup admin is not a member of the data site." - rafaAmd101 (describing acceptable configuration)

> "That sounds fine to me." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, confirming the separated key/data approach)
