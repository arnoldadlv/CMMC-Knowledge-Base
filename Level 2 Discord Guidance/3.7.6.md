- "It's a very common scenario to find switches etc. in the HVAC closet"
- Overlaps with 3.10 requirements for operational environment

## Edge Cases

### Who Does This Apply To?
Question: "The assessment guide says this control is for people who do not have physical access authorization. So is this for people like OEM staff, ESP staff, etc?"

Response (Uncouth - Fellow/CCP):
- "Yes, it's worded in the requirement as well... 'maintenance personnel without required access authorization'"
- This applies to OEM staff, ESP staff, and other external maintenance personnel

### Overlap with 3.10 Physical Protection
Question: "Is this specific control only to 'organizational systems' or also 'operational environment' as mentioned in 3.10? I am trying to understand the overlap between 3.7 and 3.10 when plumbers, hvac, fire systems... must have access to an environment covered under 3.10."

Response (Glenda R. Snodgrass - Lead CCA):
- "I believe it overlaps and requires those maintenance people to be monitored and escorted as visitors also"
- "It's a very common scenario to find switches etc. in the HVAC closet"
- Both organizational systems and operational environment need consideration

## Evidence Examples

- Visitor escort procedures for maintenance personnel
- Sign-in/sign-out logs for maintenance visits
- Policy requiring supervision of unauthorized maintenance personnel
- Documentation of who has required access authorization for CUI vs. who doesn't
- Training records for personnel who supervise maintenance
