# 3.10.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.10.1[a] authorized individuals allowed physical access are identified.
- 3.10.1[b] physical access to organizational systems is limited to authorized individuals.
- 3.10.1[c] physical access to equipment is limited to authorized individuals.
- 3.10.1[d] physical access to operating environments is limited to authorized individuals.

## Sufficient

### Physical Barriers for Manufacturing/Shop Floors
- **Chain-link fence enclosure with locked access** is acceptable when CUI (printed documents) is stored in locked cabinets at end of day. Rybo (Moderator/Fellow): "If you have a locked file cabinet to securely store the prints, a simple chain link fence enclosure would be fine. We see that all the time on shop floors."
- Chain-link as a **second layer within an existing controlled area** is considered acceptable by community consensus (MonkSecurity - CCP confirmed).

### Work From Home / Hybrid Environments
- **Written WFH Policy or Procedure with user training** is sufficient. Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor): "Write a Work From Home Policy or Procedure and train your users on it. Specify how they are to handle CUI at home and meet this control along with a number of others. Largely policy control for these is the only option."

### Open Bay Doors / Manufacturing Heat Issues
- **Open garage doors with signage and employee training** to challenge strangers is acceptable. Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor): "Prop the door open. Have a sign. Train people to challenge strangers. A policy control is a valid control."
- Add **documented training plan with quarterly refreshers** and reasoning documentation. MarieRamsay (Moderator/Fellow): "If you were able to show reasoning behind your decision, plus the Policy, plus intentional and specific physical security training, I think your Assessor would be more assured you have things under control."

### Printing CUI Policy
- **Written policy prohibiting CUI printing** is acceptable. Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor): "It's fine to have a written policy that CUI is never printed."
- **Signage at printers** reinforces policy during audits. nfaustino: "Having signs at the printer that explains all that helps for the physical audit, did for us" - simple text like "reproduction or printing of CUI is prohibited...."

### In-Scope Employees Without CUI Access
- Non-CUI employees in a CUI space can remain if treated as in-scope (CRMA). Uncouth (CCP, Consultant): "that's fine. they just need to be treated like they're in scope. if you say you do background checks, they need them too. if you have different controls you might need to consider them as escorted visitors"

### Basic Physical Access Controls
- **Ring cameras on doors + employee fobs** for facility access is a reasonable baseline.

### Shared Workspace with Non-CUI Personnel
- **Treat it like Starbucks** - obscure screens, careful about sensitive conversations. Uncouth (CCP): "if it's not a protected space where everyone is authorized, then treat it like Starbucks. Obscure the screen, be careful about sensitive conversations, etc." - Apply alternate work site type controls.

## Insufficient

### Chain-Link Fence Debates
- One gap analysis consultant suggested chain-link might not pass audit, recommending drywall ("drywall is apparently magical"). However, **community members disagreed**, viewing this as assessor overthinking. MonkSecurity (CCP): "fencing is just as a layer around switch. Seems OK to me. Sounds like C3PAO is overthinking it."
- The key factor appears to be **layered controls**: chain-link inside an already controlled perimeter + camera coverage is generally acceptable.

### Physical Parts vs. Information
- **Physical items (parts, manufactured goods) are NOT CUI**. Rybo (Moderator/Fellow): "physical items (parts, etc.) aren't information, and so they cannot be CUI." Only printed documents, drawings, or displayed information qualifies.

---

## Over-engineering

### Full Physical Isolation for Few Non-CUI Employees
- Not required to physically isolate 2-3 employees who don't need CUI access from the rest of the office. Uncouth (CCP): "I think you're over thinking things." Alternate work site controls or treating them as in-scope is sufficient.

### 18-foot Walls to Ceiling for Manufacturing
- When storing CUI drawings in locked cabinets at end of day, chain-link fence is sufficient - no need for floor-to-ceiling walls.

### Technical Printer Controls to Block CUI
- Not required if policy prohibits printing. Written policy + signage is sufficient. No need for DLP or print blocking technology for this control.

### Requiring Drywall Instead of Chain-Link
- Some consultants recommend solid walls over chain-link for network equipment. Community consensus suggests this may be overly conservative when chain-link is a second layer inside a controlled area with camera coverage.

---

## Edge Cases

### Wall Height for Manufacturing Enclosures
- Question raised about 13ft vs 18ft walls for manufacturing floor CUI area. Resolution: If CUI is stored in locked cabinet at end of day, chain-link fence is acceptable - wall height becomes less critical.

### Open Garage Doors in Hot Weather
- Acceptable with compensating controls: signage, visitor sign-in, escorted visitors, camera monitoring, and employee training to challenge strangers.

### Developer Next to Technical Writer (Non-CUI Role)
- If not in a protected space where everyone is authorized, apply alternate work site controls: screen obscuring, careful conversations. Non-CUI person can be in CRMA role with appropriate controls.

### Network Switches on Manufacturing Floor
- Chain-link fence around switches inside an already controlled area (badge access building, camera coverage) was challenged by one assessor citing 3.10.1[d]. Community opinion was the assessor was overthinking - chain-link as second layer should be sufficient.

### Organizational System vs. Equipment Distinction (3.10.1[b] vs 3.10.1[c])
- Question raised but not clearly resolved. Guidance: "NIST hates us and uses terms like 'the system' to encapsulate any aspects of the system, including people, processes, information, and probably physical areas where you can view or overhear sensitive info. Try reading 800-171 Rev 3 for better, more concrete requirements based on 800-53 control language."

## Evidence Examples

### Documented/Accepted
- Work From Home Policy with user training
- Alternative Work Site Policy (covers hotels, airports, etc.)
- Signage at printers stating CUI printing is prohibited
- Badge access logs for facility entry
- Camera footage covering controlled areas and network equipment
- Visitor sign-in sheets
- Employee training records on physical security and visitor handling
- Locked cabinets for CUI document storage
- Chain-link fence with locked gate for equipment areas (within controlled perimeter)

### Discussed but Outcome Unclear
- Ring cameras on doors (mentioned as reasonable but not explicitly confirmed by assessor)
