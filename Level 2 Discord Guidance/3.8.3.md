# 3.8.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Sanitize or destroy system media containing CUI before disposal or release for reuse.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.3[a] system media containing CUI is sanitized or destroyed before disposal.
- 3.8.3[b] system media containing CUI is sanitized before it is released for reuse.

---

## Sufficient

- **NIST 800-88 "Clear" technique for internal reuse:** Factory reset or Windows "Remove Everything" with "Clean Data" option can satisfy internal reuse requirements if the technique clears all user-addressable storage locations.

- **NIST 800-88 "Purge" technique for media leaving organization:** Recommended approach per NARA guidance. Includes:
  - ATA Sanitize command (valid purge for HDDs)
  - NVM Express Format command (valid for NVMe drives)
  - Cryptographic erase (deleting the Media Encryption Key when using FIPS-validated encryption)
  - Single-pass wipe on BitLocker encrypted drives with pre-boot authentication

- **Cryptographic erase via BitLocker key rotation:** "In 2024 the answer to all of this is cryptographic erase. AKA use bitlocker and then cycle the key." Considered a valid sanitization method.

- **Physical destruction via shredding:** On-site shredding by vendors like Iron Mountain with certificates of destruction is widely accepted.

- **Paper CUI destruction via third-party shredding with recycling:** A Moderator confirmed that using an on-site shredding company that then recycles the shreds is compliant per NARA CUI Notice 2019-03.

- **Dell Data Wipe:** Specifically documented as NIST 800-88 R1 compliant for supported sanitize actions.

- **Documentation:** Destruction logs tracking assets, drives, memory components, and items destroyed.

---

## Insufficient

- **Vendor-provided "sanitization" without NIST 800-88 compliance documentation:** Example given of Sharp multifunction printers where the vendor stated "the only way for SHARP multifunctions to guarantee that all data is completely erased from any device is for the customer to destroy any of the memory types that are of concern." Such vendor hedging puts the requirement back on the organization.

- **Factory reset without understanding what it actually does:** Need to verify whether factory reset clears user-addressable storage locations per 800-88. Cannot assume it does.

- **Deleting BitLocker recovery keys from SharePoint alone:** Simply deleting unlocking keys from external storage is not cryptographic erase. The MEK is typically stored on the drive itself; you must understand the technology-specific process.

- **Methods dependent solely on assessor interpretation:** "I am inclined to push back against using any method that is dependent on interpretation."

---

## Over-engineering

- **NSA-approved destruction for CUI:** "Some people take it too far and go NSA approved destruction, but I consider that way overkill" for CUI/moderate systems.

- **Requiring specific shred sizes for paper:** "General consensus there is no prescriptive shred size for CMMC." NIST 800-88 R2 removed prescriptive shred sizes.

- **Treating encrypted CUI as requiring all CUI controls:** A Certified CMMC Assessor (Spock67) argues the DoD statement that "encrypted CUI is still CUI" is "an unhinged argument that cannot be followed through on because it breaks the internet." The long-time NSA view is that "cipher text does not hold the same classification of the underlying plain text."

---

## Edge Cases

- **Copier/printer SSDs that cannot be removed at end of lease:** Require vendor documentation confirming 800-88 compliance for built-in sanitization features. If vendor cannot confirm, the organization bears risk.

- **Multi-step paper destruction (non-compliant shredder + burning):** 800-88 explicitly allows "methods not specified in this table may be suitable as long as they are verifiable and found satisfactory by the organization." Burning paper shreds to ash is verifiably irrecoverable, but "going off the beaten path can be risky" for C3PAO assessments.

- **Media with unknown encryption status (backlog of cleared drives):** If drives were processed via Secure Erase sanitizer (ATA Sanitize command), this is a valid 800-88 "purge" regardless of previous BitLocker status.

- **Intune Wipe functionality:** Dependent on implementation details. Intune wipe coupled with forced BitLocker encryption may suffice with proper documentation, but verify what the wipe actually does.

- **Contract-specific requirements:** Follow contract requirements first. If contract only says "destroy according to ISOO guidance," the 2019 NARA ISOO memo on multi-step destruction is valid. CMMC regulation (32 CFR Part 170) does not mandate 800-88; it's referenced in 800-171 discussions but "discussions do not add requirements."

- **Physical shreds still require CUI protections:** Until final destruction, non-compliant shreds "still need the same physical protections as your documents."

## Evidence Examples

- Destruction logs tracking: asset identifier, component drive, memory components, other items requiring destruction
- Certificates of destruction from vendors (Iron Mountain, local shredders)
- Vendor documentation confirming NIST 800-88 compliance (e.g., Dell Data Wipe documentation)
- Policy/procedure documenting sanitization methods aligned to 800-88 Clear/Purge/Destroy
- Records of on-site witnessed destruction
- BitLocker key rotation records (for cryptographic erase)
- Technology-specific documentation of what sanitization commands actually do

> "I would say in 2024 the answer to all of this is cryptographic erase. AKA use bitlocker and then cycle the key." - John (Established Member)

> "In my view, from a consulting perspective I recommend purge IAW 800-88 as the approach. From an assessor perspective I am not failing someone if they use Clear or other reasonable methods." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, CCP)

> "According to recent statements by the DoD, encrypted CUI is still CUI... I 100% agree with you, and, as an assessor, I'm not going to fail someone on this. Playing devil's advocate a bit and from the OSC perspective -- OSCs may (not that they have to) need to consider being above reproach on this as not all assessors will hold this same view." - socketsetter (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "There are many different ways to wipe the data. For CUI and lower, it depends on the technology. NIST 800-88 gives an overview of the methods and details on how to implement them." - Alabaster (Verified)

> "The ATA Sanitize command is a valid 800-88 'purge'. (NVM Express Format command as well). If that is what you've already done, then you've met NIST requirements for moderate media leaving your org, regardless of whether/how the drive has been encrypted." - JB (Verified)

> "TL;DR, I think the ISOO memo is a government-wide policy and it is fine to follow it unless your contract says otherwise" - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow, CCP)

> "32 CFR Part 170 makes zero mention of 800-88. 32 CFR Part 2002 does mention 800-88... CFR are still directive of the agencies and refer to the agencies, the requirement for contractors come from their contracts." - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow, CCP)

> "Shredding is generally the way to go." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor, Fellow)

> "Going off the beaten path can be risky, since many NIST standards are written with government organizations in mind as 'the organization' approving things, so anything outside 800-88 would definitely be a good C3PAO interview question." - JB (Verified)

> "Cryptographic erase is a 'purge' for 800-88. Whether or not you're actually doing a full CE when you 'erase/delete the cryptographic key' is very technology-dependent." - JB (Verified)
