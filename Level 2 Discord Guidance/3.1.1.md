# 3.1.1 - Expertise Overlay

## Sufficient

- **Excel spreadsheet listing authorized users/devices/service accounts** - Assessors confirmed this works as the "ground truth" list. Must include: Name, Justification of lawful government purpose, Date validated.
- **MAC address filtering on firewall** for device authorization (for objective [f]) - A CCP confirmed "in my opinion that works."
- **IP allowlist on firewall** for device authorization - Expert noted "that IP allowlist is the real story here" for limiting device access.
- **List of NPE (service) accounts with AD permissions screenshots** - Confirmed sufficient for objective [b] when combined with documentation of what they do and how they were authorized.
- **Bi-weekly network scanning** to detect unauthorized devices, with Tech Lead reviewing and removing unauthorized devices - Assessor confirmed "that's fine for a small org" though "it won't scale well."
- **SSP addressing asset categories** (e.g., all laptops, all security protection assets) rather than individual assets - Lead CCA confirmed this approach with "Nailed it."
- **Policy + device connection log audits** for small virtual organizations (<10 users) without MDM - Discussed as viable for limiting device access in cloud-only environments.
- **App containers with logical/physical separation** (e.g., Microsoft Outlook Managed App with data containerization) - Allows the underlying BYOD device to be CRMA/out of scope while the container is in scope.

## Insufficient

- **Entra ID/AD user list alone as evidence of authorization** - Lead CCA stated: "I don't know any assessor that would accept the Entra user list for list of authorized users." Reason: Your AD list represents reality, not what's authorized. An attacker who creates a user would be "authorized" by that logic.
- **Verbal authorization without records** - Expert stated: "I see no way an assessor can validate something done <some time ago> verbally in a meeting if no records of that were kept."
- **Policy-only approach without technical enforcement** for device limiting - "This falls apart quickly with even a small number of users." Must have security control assessment procedure (3.12.1) and logs to check effectiveness.
- **Relying on physical access controls only** for device authorization - Expert noted "I've never seen someone try to satisfy 3.1.1 primarily using physical access restrictions. Authentication is usually the first stop."
- **Claiming requirement met because "everyone knows who should have access"** - This is a "white box perspective" that fails when assessed by external parties who weren't around when access was granted.

## Over-engineering

- **Disabling Bluetooth entirely** - Called "an overboard position to take." Only 3.4.7 mentions Bluetooth, and only says organizations should "consider" disabling it. Alternatively, just block file transfer options via Intune CSP.
- **Implementing automated detection/blocking for new service accounts (PAOBOAU)** - User was over-complicating. Expert simplified: "at its core this one is just 'here's a list of the service accounts, here's what they do, here's how they were authorized.'"
- **Requiring customer/external party devices to be in your device authorization scope** - Expert clarified: "your customers accessing you is not your problem and shouldn't need to be part of your answer for 3.1.1[f]." External participants can be handled as a supply chain problem with attestation.
- **Listing controls per individual asset** - SSP should address categories of assets, not each individual device separately; otherwise "there will be a lot of redundancy."

## Edge Cases

- **Service accounts from shared AD infrastructure** - If you have multiple labs under one AD and only one is in CMMC scope: "they don't have to live under an OU or CN or anything like that together. it's just an account and it exists and it's now in your scope too even if it originated from somewhere else."
- **Web applications with external DOD customers** - Customer device authorization is their problem, not yours. Use attestation/contractual language where they confirm compliance. "Sign here as an external customer or agency saying you are compliant and can handle CUI and only do it from endpoints that can do so."
- **Local accounts on domain-joined computers** - Confirmed "Yes" - local accounts must be included in your authorized user inventory.
- **Web servers with IIS** - Service accounts for web servers running as system accounts need to be inventoried. "Got a web server running IIS? Is that running as you or a different account? Might want to inventory that too."
- **3.1.1 vs 3.5.2 distinction** - 3.1.1 is about having a list and limiting to that list; 3.5.2 is about authentication. "3.1.1[a] authorize people so you know who should be able to access the system. 3.1.1[d] don't let unauthorized people access the system. 3.5.2[a] authenticate or verify users as a prereq to access."

## Evidence Examples

- **Access Authorization List** (Excel/spreadsheet) with columns: Name | Justification of lawful government purpose | Date validated
- **Screenshot of conditional access policies** (for objective [d])
- **AD GPO showing logon groups** (for objective [d])
- **Screenshots of NPE account permissions from Active Directory** (for objective [b])
- **Firewall IP/MAC allowlist configuration**
- **Change ticket or service ticket** documenting how service accounts were authorized
- **Baseline documentation** showing expected service accounts/processes for applications
- **Network scan results** with comparison to approved device list
- **Device connection logs** (for auditing compliance)

## Key Quotes

- "Your AAD user list represents reality, not what's authorized." - JB (upvoted by CCA and CCP)
- "How did your IT know to create those users in the first place?" - scotty, CCP (5 endorsements)
- "You need an external list that is the source of truth." - Art_Vandelay
