# 3.6.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Establish an operational incident-handling capability for organizational systems that includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, recovery, and user response activities.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.6.1[a] an operational incident-handling capability is established
- 3.6.1[b] the operational incident-handling capability includes preparation
- 3.6.1[c] the operational incident-handling capability includes detection
- 3.6.1[d] the operational incident-handling capability includes analysis
- 3.6.1[e] the operational incident-handling capability includes containment
- 3.6.1[f] the operational incident-handling capability includes recovery
- 3.6.1[g] the operational incident-handling capability includes user response activities

## Sufficient

- **MDR tools with policies/procedures can suffice:** An MDR tool like Defender for Endpoint with adequate policies, procedures, and proper documentation can meet the control requirements. A SOC or 24/7 monitoring is NOT explicitly required.
  - Source: Certified CMMC Assessor (Spock67): "100% not required." (in response to whether SOC/24/7 monitoring is required)

- **Physical incidents involving CUI must be included:** If computers containing CUI are stolen, this falls under incident response requirements.
  - Source: Lead CCA (Glenda R. Snodgrass): "If there is CUI on those computers, deffo yes."

- **Separate physical and cyber IR plans are acceptable:** Organizations can maintain separate plans - FSO handles physical loss/theft under DCSA rules, CISO handles Cyber IRP under 171 rules. Some overlap is expected.
  - Source: Certified CMMC Assessor (Spock67): "I have also seen this broken out separately. So the FSO has a plan for dealing with physical loss, theft and conforms to the DCSA rules, and the CISO has a Cyber IRP that more closely aligns to the 171 rules. Both should be covered. Potentially some overlap. Break purely for organizational reasons."

- **User response activities (3.6.1[g]):** This means users have defined roles and responsibilities in handling incidents - reporting to appropriate authorities, following prescribed procedures, assisting in investigation, and implementing remediation measures.

## Insufficient

No explicit discussion of insufficient implementations found in the channel.

## Over-engineering

- **SOC/24/7 monitoring is NOT required:** While some may consider it necessary for "timely" response (referencing 3.3.1 and 3.6.1), assessors confirm it is not a requirement.
  - Source: Question asked whether SOC is required for "timely" detection. Certified CMMC Assessor response: "100% not required."

## Edge Cases

- **External MSSP for incident response and scope implications:** Discussion about keeping external incident response teams out of scope. One approach presented:
  - Treat one MSSP employee as an OSC employee (OSC-owned credentials, devices, consoles)
  - MSSP only called in for critical incidents on CUI devices
  - If scoping MSSP is too burdensome, alternative is: "destroy the device and rebuild"
  - For tiny enclaves (3 CUI devices), this risk-based approach was considered acceptable

- **ECA Certificate requirement unclear:** DoD Final Rule 2024-04752 (effective 11-Apr-2024) removed the requirement for DIB to have DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents, but DFARS still carries the requirement. No resolution found in discussion - users noted they renewed certificates for 3 more years hoping for clarity.

- **Physical theft vs. cyber incidents:** AG examples focus on cyber incidents, but physical theft of CUI-containing devices is also covered. Assessors warn: "If you're talking about the Examples in the AGs, remember that those are not prescriptive and not comprehensive. They make a good starting point, provide food for thought, but following them will not get you a MET on everything."
