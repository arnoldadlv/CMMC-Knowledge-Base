# 3.11.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, resulting from the operation of organizational systems and the associated processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.11.1[a]: The frequency to assess risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals is defined.
- 3.11.1[b]: Risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals resulting from the operation of an organizational system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI is assessed with the defined frequency.

## Sufficient

- A risk assessment that covers the entire scope of things that affect the CUI environment
- Using an existing company-wide risk assessment if the CUI environment shares infrastructure with other IT systems (e.g., same datacenter, same power systems)
- Focusing on risks specifically related to CUI: unauthorized access, disclosure, information spills
- Defined frequency for conducting risk assessments

## Insufficient

- A risk assessment that only addresses general organizational risks without specifically addressing CUI-related risks
- No defined frequency for risk assessments (assessment objective [a] explicitly requires defined frequency)

## Over-engineering

- Including natural disasters (earthquakes, flooding) as primary focus when the control specifically addresses risks "resulting from the operation of an organizational system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI" - physical/environmental risks are not the focus per rybo (Moderator/Fellow)
- Creating entirely separate risk assessments for CUI environment when existing company risk assessments already cover the same infrastructure

## Edge Cases

**Shared Infrastructure:** When CUI environment resides in the same datacenter as other IT systems, the same risk assessment used for generic company assets can apply. No need to duplicate assessments for shared infrastructure components like power systems.

**Relationship to 3.11.2 and 3.11.3:** This control is NOT directly tied to vulnerability scanning (3.11.2). Risk assessment under 3.11.1 focuses on risks from operating systems that handle CUI, not on scanning for obsolete software or virus checking.

**CUI-Specific vs. General Risk:** The focus should be on: "What new risks do you now face that you didn't before [having CUI] or what risks have increased/exist due to CUI being present that didn't exist when CUI wasn't present." This is distinct from traditional risk assessments that include natural disasters.

## Evidence Examples

- CIS-RAM templates (recommended as an "easy template" option)
- Risk assessment documentation with defined frequency
- Evidence that risk assessment covers CUI-specific risks (unauthorized access, disclosure, information spills)

## Key Quotes

**On Scope:**
> "This is intended to be for the entire scope of things that affect your CUI environment." - ace_rimmer (Fellow)

**On Physical Risks vs. CUI Risks:**
> "If I'm assessing the risks described in the AO... then I'm not focusing on earthquakes. I'm focused on unauthorized access, disclosure, information spills, and stuff like that." - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

**On CUI-Specific Risk Focus:**
> "You're an org who just started processing, storing, and transmitting CUI. What new risks do you now face that you didn't before or what risks have increased/exist due to CUI being present that didn't exist when CUI wasn't present. This has nothing to do with a general/traditional risk assessment that would include natural disasters and such in my opinion." - Cuipacabra, CCP

**On Using Existing Assessments:**
> "Generally you can probably use the same risk assessment you are using for your generic company assets." - ace_rimmer (Fellow)

**On Templates:**
> "Do a risk assessment. If you want an easy template, you can use the CIS-RAM templates." - ace_rimmer (Fellow)
