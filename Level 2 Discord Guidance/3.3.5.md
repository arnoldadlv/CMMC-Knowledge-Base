# 3.3.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Correlate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- [a] audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity are defined.
- [b] defined audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes are correlated.

## Sufficient

**Two Valid Interpretations - "Both" Approach Recommended:**

1. **Option 1 (Process-Based):** When suspicious logs are generated, someone notices and starts doing incident response. "See something, do something." Focus on the word "processes" meaning manual activities performed by people. This interpretation links logging to incident response.

2. **Option 2 (Technical Correlation):** All logs from all systems go to a central place (SIEM) so you can correlate multiple sources using technical means.

**What Passes:**
- Defined processes for: (1) audit record review, (2) analysis, and (3) reporting - all tied to investigating/responding to suspicious activity
- Automated review and analysis via detection queries that result in alerts (reporting) per 3.3.6
- Review process involving: looking at detection alerts, IOCs, file hashes, behavioral analysis, determining if noteworthy
- If actual incident detected, escalate/report internally
- Kieri Solutions passed DIBCAC assessment using BOTH approaches: processes ensuring incidents start when scary activity appears in logs + SIEM usage

**Alternative Log Sources Acceptable:**
- EDR tools (e.g., CrowdStrike) can substitute for OS event logs if they provide needed information
- Must still define what you're logging and monitoring in line with other requirements
- "No specific need for OS Event Logs if you get what you need otherwise" - Uncouth, CCP (Fellow)
- Assessor confirmed: "I would allow that. You would need to think through it and match up your definitions" - Spock67, CCA

## Insufficient

**Red Flag - Zero Incidents with SOC/MSSP:**
- Companies paying external SOC/MSSPs thousands per month with "zero" incidents in the last year raises concerns
- This suggests audit record review is NOT being correlated to analysis and reporting processes
- Indicates disconnect between logging and incident response

**Missing Link Problem:**
- 800-171 requires lots of logs AND lots of incident response
- Without proper 3.3.5 implementation, there's no link between the two
- Having logs alone is not sufficient without defined processes connecting them to incident response

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

**Interpreting "Correlate":**
- This is the 8th most likely requirement to be "other than satisfied" per DoD DCAC
- The ambiguity stems from whether "correlate" means:
  - Correlate PROCESSES (people-based workflow linking log review to incident response)
  - Correlate LOGS (technical SIEM-based correlation of data from multiple systems)
- Expert recommendation: Address BOTH interpretations to be safe

**Alternative Logging Sources:**
- CrowdStrike or similar EDR can potentially satisfy endpoint logging requirements
- Must demonstrate it provides: incident/misuse detection, security function recording, login correlation with AD
- Key: must DEFINE what you're logging and monitoring to align with other requirements

---

## Evidence Examples

**Examinable Objects (from discussion):**
- Procedures addressing investigation of and response to suspicious activities
- Mechanisms supporting analysis and correlation of audit records (SIEM)

**Acceptable Evidence Discussed:**
- Detection alert review processes (IOCs, file hashes, behavioral analysis)
- Escalation/reporting procedures for actual incidents
- SIEM or log correlation tool configuration
- EDR telemetry (if properly defined and documented as alternative to OS event logs)

## Key Quotes

**Amira Armond (C3PAO, Fellow) - On Interpretation:**
> "I think that Option 1 is the best way to interpret this requirement. I'm looking at the word 'processes' to mean manual activities performed by people. Without Option 1, we have a problem where 800-171 requires lots of logs, and it requires lots of incident response, but there is no link between the two."

**Amira Armond - On SOC/MSSP Red Flag:**
> "I've talked to many companies that hired external SOC services or MSSPs, are paying them thousands of dollars per month, and have had 'zero' incidents in the last year. Really? C'mon."

**Amira Armond - On Passing Assessment:**
> "In preparation for Kieri Solution's CMMC assessment by DIBCAC, we took the 'both' approach to be safe. We discussed how we have processes that ensure incidents are started when there is scary activity in the logs. We also mentioned how we use a SIEM. Our assessors were satisfied."

**rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP) - On Process Definition:**
> "For [a]: review and analysis are joined at the hip. If you 'provided' log query and reporting capabilities per 3.3.6, you'll ideally have an automated review and analysis process that results in alerts (reporting) based on predefined detection queries."

**scotty, CCP - On Breaking Down Requirements:**
> "First we have to define what? Three things: 1) audit record review processes, 2) analysis processes, 3) reporting processes. Why? For investigating and responding to indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity."

**Uncouth, CCP (Fellow) - On Alternative Log Sources:**
> "Depends on how you define it but yeah no specific need for OS Event Logs if you get what you need otherwise"

**Spock67, CCA - On EDR as Alternative:**
> "I would allow that. You would need to think through it and match up your definitions but I think it could be done."
