# 3.11.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications are identified.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.11.2[a] the frequency to scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications is defined.
- 3.11.2[b] vulnerability scans are performed on organizational systems with the defined frequency.
- 3.11.2[c] vulnerability scans are performed on applications with the defined frequency.
- 3.11.2[d] vulnerability scans are performed on organizational systems when new vulnerabilities are identified.
- 3.11.2[e] vulnerability scans are performed on applications when new vulnerabilities are identified.

**Failure Rate:** 18% (Fifth-most "Other than Satisfied" CMMC requirement per Amira Armond)

## Sufficient

### Scope of Scanning
- Scan the entire network boundary-to-boundary, not just CUI assets
- CUIA (CUI Assets) and SPA (Security Protection Assets) must be scanned
- CRMA (Contractor Risk Managed Assets) should be included if they can affect CUI security
- Credentialed scans are required to detect application vulnerabilities (Nessus requires credentials to scan applications)
- Enable credentialed scans on all equipment that supports it

### Scan Frequency
- "Periodically" means at minimum once per year, but quarterly is better and more normal
- Continuous/automated scanning within a day or two of vulnerability discovery exceeds the requirement

### Responding to New Vulnerabilities (AO d and e)
- Updating the vulnerability scanner before each scan so it checks for new vulnerabilities is acceptable
- Having a documented process for scanning threat intelligence and taking action when relevant vulnerabilities are identified
- Example: Subscribe to CISA vulnerability emails and Cyberwire, scan daily for items that might impact your environment, investigate and take action, save evidence

### Mobile Devices
- Per DoD Cybersecurity FAQ A83: Mobile devices are NOT considered information systems
- Therefore 3.11.2 does not require vulnerability scanning of mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- Alternative approach: Track new exploits to Android/iOS, enforce minimum OS requirements, use mobile application management

### Specialized/Edge Equipment
- If a firewall doesn't support credentialed scanning (e.g., FIPS mode requirement blocks SSH), document the limitation
- Frame it as: "We enable credentialed scans on all equipment that supports it" rather than "We don't do credentialed scans on X"
- A basic vulnerability scan plus manual firmware version checking can be acceptable for devices that cannot support credentialed scans
- Shows consideration of risk and judgment when there's a valid security reason (like maintaining FIPS mode)

### Network Segmentation Factor
- If assets are properly segmented behind deny-by-default firewalls and have no CUI connectivity, vulnerability scanning is less critical
- Segmentation is a key factor in determining scanning requirements

---

## Insufficient

### Only Scanning CUI Assets
- Scanning only the 10 CUI workstations while ignoring 90 other workstations on the same broadcast domain without software firewalls = likely fail
- Most assessors expect boundary-to-boundary scanning (poll confirmed overwhelming consensus)
- Two known DIBCAC assessments expected full network vulnerability scans

### Only Scanning Convenient Systems
- Scanning office systems but ignoring laptops on the road = likely fail
- Need a plan for 100% remote assets

### Patching Instead of Scanning
- Simply stating "we update all applications quarterly" is NOT a substitute for vulnerability scanning
- There are separate requirements for patching (3.14.1) and vulnerability scanning (3.11.2) - both must be satisfied

### Missing Application Scanning
- Scanning Linux OS but not scanning the WordPress website hosted on the server = incomplete
- "Applications" primarily means software with listening network ports (web servers, database servers, file servers)
- These are high-risk for compromise and require separate scanning from OS-level scans

### Forgetting Entire Environments
- Forgetting to scan the Linux environment = problems
- Not accounting for all asset types = problems

### No Response to Major Vulnerabilities
- If your network existed in 2021 and you can't demonstrate a vulnerability scan in response to Log4Shell = fail
- Must be able to demonstrate scanning in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities

---

## Over-engineering

### Mobile Device Vulnerability Scanning
- Deploying MDE or Crowdstrike Falcon to mobile devices for vulnerability scanning goes beyond what most organizations do
- No known DIBCAC-assessed orgs are trying to vulnerability scan mobile devices
- Can be a "safe" approach until there's a clear verdict, but is not required

### Continuous Scanning
- Performing automated vulnerability scans within a day or two of each vulnerability detection exceeds the requirement (per Amira)
- Some tools like Tanium scan nearly continuously and receive vendor updates almost immediately - this is above and beyond

### Manual Threat Intelligence Process
- Manually consuming CISA emails and Cyberwire daily, documenting investigations, and saving email streams as evidence is well ahead of vulnerability scanner updates and "possibly above and beyond" (per Spock67)

---

## Edge Cases

### Mobile Devices
- DoD FAQ A83 states mobile devices are not information systems
- This creates ambiguity - "my phone accessed CUI, how can we rationally argue that it isn't an organizational system?"
- Current practice: Most orgs don't vulnerability scan mobile devices, but one assessor might require it while another won't
- Safest approach until clarity: Deploy vulnerability scanning to mobile devices if feasible, or be prepared to defend the exclusion with FAQ A83

### Printers
- Similar ambiguity to mobile devices - one assessor might require scanning, another might not

### Firewalls That Don't Support Credentialed Scanning
- Some firewalls require disabling FIPS mode to enable SSH for credentialed scans
- Acceptable approach: Do basic vulnerability scans, document that FIPS mode prevents credentialed scanning, check firmware versions manually
- Shows risk consideration when there's a valid security tradeoff

### Network Devices (Switches, Firewalls)
- Microsoft Defender has deprecated its ability to scan networking devices
- Nessus/Tenable are the recommended tools for scanning network devices
- "Generally the answer is you need a tool to do it. Nessus, Tenable etc."
- Some inventive approaches exist with scripting and NMAP for very small environments

### Scanning Account MFA Exemption
- The account used for credentialed scanning is a good candidate for MFA exemption (per Amira)
- Duo 2FA can create problems for credentialed scans

### Resource Constraints and Network Redesign
- Some orgs only scan certain network segments based on resource constraints
- Running first vulnerability scans can reveal so much technical debt that orgs segment their network to contain what they can manage
- "Vulnerability scanning begets network redesigns"

### Policy Periodicity Strategy
- Recommendation: Define a longer periodicity in policy (e.g., quarterly) but actually scan more frequently (e.g., weekly)
- "What we normally do is more frequent than we do in response to the defined compliance requirement"
- Provides leeway if an assessor wants to fail you for missing a single weekly scan on a road laptop

---

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence
- Vulnerability scan reports with timestamps showing defined frequency
- Credentialed scan results showing application vulnerabilities
- Documentation of scanner updates before scans
- Evidence of response to specific vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4Shell scan results from 2021)
- CISA/Cyberwire email subscriptions with saved action documentation
- Remediation tickets/POA&M entries from scan findings

### Tools Mentioned
- Nessus/Nessus Essentials (free for small orgs, up to ~16 IPs)
- Tenable
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (limitations: only Windows endpoints, deprecated network device scanning, may not identify all vulnerabilities)
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management dashboard
- Defendify (uses Nessus, bundled with awareness training and dark web scanning)
- Tanium (continuous scanning)
- Crowdstrike Falcon (mobile device scanning)
- NMAP with scripting (very small environments only)

### Cloud Scanner Considerations
- If using a cloud vulnerability scanner on subscription with scheduled scans, question remains on how to satisfy AO d and e if you can't manually trigger scans
- Showing how the cloud provider auto-updates their vulnerability scanner may be acceptable for those objectives
