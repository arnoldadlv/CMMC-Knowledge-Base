# 3.14.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Provide protection from malicious code at designated locations within organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.14.2[a] designated locations for malicious code protection are identified.
- 3.14.2[b] protection from malicious code at designated locations is provided.

---

## Sufficient

**Classic/Expected Footprint (per rybo - Moderator/Fellow):**
- Malware protection on full workstation/server OSs
- Gateway anti-virus on network managed interfaces (WAN, etc.)

This represents the baseline expectation for satisfying the control.

---

## Insufficient

No discussion found.

---

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

**Question raised (gera7980):** Beyond endpoints with AV/EDR, what about:
- Servers
- Networks
- Mobile phones
- Containers/pods

The user questioned whether designating only "some endpoints" would be sufficient, expressing doubt that it would be enough.

**Expert Response (rybo):** The "classic" footprint covers:
1. Full workstation/server OSs (endpoint protection)
2. Gateway anti-virus on network managed interfaces

*Note: The discussion did not explicitly address containers, mobile devices, or provide a definitive answer on whether endpoint-only designation is truly insufficient. The expert response focused on what the "classic" approach is rather than defining minimum requirements.*

## Evidence Examples

No specific evidence examples discussed (e.g., screenshots, configuration exports, policies).

> "The 'classic' footprint for malware protection is on full workstation/server OSs and gateway anti-virus on the network managed interfaces (WAN, etc.)."
> - rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "I get how to do malicious code protection at the endpoints (AV, EDR, etc). What is the general understanding on the need to do it at the servers, networks, mobile phones, inside pods/containers?"
> - gera7980 (question, not definitive guidance)

## Discussion Summary

This channel had minimal discussion (4 messages total). The primary substantive exchange involved a question about scope of malicious code protection beyond traditional endpoints, with the expert response pointing to the "classic" approach of endpoint OS protection plus gateway AV. The discussion did not reach conclusions on:
- Whether containers/pods require separate protection
- Mobile device malware protection requirements
- Whether endpoint-only designation passes assessment
- Specific tool requirements or vendor-neutral specifications
