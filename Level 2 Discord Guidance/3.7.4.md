# 3.7.4 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are used in organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.7.4 media containing diagnostic and test programs are checked for malicious code before being used in organizational systems that process, store, or transmit CUI.

## Sufficient

### Real-Time AV Protection
Per socketsetter (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "I am of the opinion that real-time protection such as MDE or S1 satisfies this requirement"
- Acknowledged that a separate scanning machine would be better, but "it's overkill... for much of the DIB"

Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "I agree that Defender and S1 can both do this handily"

Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- "The 3.14.3 requirement already implements real-time scanning of downloaded files"
- "This requirement is most often met by checking whether a maintenance tech's laptop has antivirus installed"
- If A/V is updated and running, the local disk is being scanned and flash media would be scanned when inserted

### Standalone Scanning Station
Per Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "I typically see a standalone or otherwise restricted/protected device used to scan USBs before they are permitted access to the CUI environment"
- "And it meets this control for scanning prior to connecting to the protected system"
- Used for accounting clients receiving USB drives from clients

## Insufficient

### Scanning While In Use
Question raised: "We have Auto Scan Policy in our AV so when they plug in it runs a scan automatically, however you can technically use the USB while its scanning...the wording here says BEFORE use?"

Response (Glenda R. Snodgrass - Lead CCA):
- A standalone scanning station addresses the "before" requirement
- Scanning prior to connecting to the protected system is the key

---

## Over-engineering

### Separate Air-Gapped Scanning Machine
Per Cuipacabra, CCP:
- In classified environments, USBs were scanned on a separate airgapped computer before insertion
- For CMMC/unclassified side: "Having a separate computer just for scanning vendor laptops/removable media when AV with RTP and auto-scan removable media features exists... seems like overkill"

---

## Edge Cases

### Definition of "Media"
Question: "Is there any guidance that points to the word media that indicates that it is physical like flash drive or optical disk or can this be anything that comes from the internet?"

Response (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- NIST Glossary definition: "Physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, Large-Scale Integration (LSI) memory chips, and printouts (but not including display media) onto which information is recorded, stored, or printed within a system"
- Reference: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/media

Response (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):
- 3.14.3 already covers real-time scanning of downloaded files
- This requirement focuses on physical media from maintenance technicians

---

## Evidence Examples

- AV/endpoint protection with real-time scanning enabled
- Auto-scan on removable media insertion policy
- Standalone USB scanning station (if used)
- Policy documenting media scanning requirements
- Evidence of updated A/V definitions

## Key Quotes

> "The 3.14.3 requirement already implements real-time scanning of downloaded files. This requirement is most often met by checking whether a maintenance tech's laptop has antivirus installed. The assumption is that, if A/V is updated and running, that the local disk is being scanned and that flash media would also be scanned when inserted."
