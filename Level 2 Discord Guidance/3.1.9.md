# 3.1.9 - Expertise Overlay
## Privacy and Security Notices

**Control Text:** Provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.9[a] privacy and security notices required by CUI-specified rules are identified, consistent, and associated with the specific CUI category.
- 3.1.9[b] privacy and security notices are displayed.

---

## Sufficient

**Login banner at system entry point:**
- "A login banner has always worked for DIBCAC audits." - rybo (Moderator, Fellow)
- Login banners displayed before authentication are consistently accepted

**Desktop background with notice (no click-through required):**
- "We don't do a login banner.... we have our default background set with our notice so nobody has to click through. DIBCAC was fine with that as well" - Jake (Fellow)

**Single entry point notice (not every system hop):**
- "We have not seen that as a requirement to be on every system you log into" - Jake (Fellow)
- "Not in my view, and I dont think DIBCAC is making that interpretation either." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
- Secondary notices for downstream applications are risk-based, not mandatory per NIST 800-171 discussion

**Generic CUI statement in banner:**
- "The CUI-Specified categories typically just require that you indicate that the system contains CUI. No need to specify the exact categories of CUI in the banner" - Liatris (Lead CCA, C3PAO)
- Banner should state system "may contain CUI" and reference company policy

**Posters/printed materials as alternative:**
- "Where necessary, posters or other printed materials may be used in lieu of an automated system banner." - Tarnish (Certified CMMC Assessor), citing 800-171 r2 Discussion

**MDM notification during device enrollment:**
- "We use an MDM notification during device enrollment that CUI might be present and refer to policy and procedures for handling." - Sparky3089

---

## Insufficient

**Requiring banner on EVERY platform storing CUI:**
- A consultant "docked us for this control, as we do not have a notice displayed on logon to EVERY platform that stores CUI" (e.g., GDrive)
- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor) responded: "That sounds broad" and quoted 800-171: "Based on a risk assessment, organizations consider whether a secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon"
- Consensus: This interpretation is too broad; initial workstation login notice is sufficient when access requires managed devices

---

## Over-engineering

**Banners on every hop/application after initial login:**
- Not required per 800-171 and DIBCAC practice
- "Organizations need to consider whether a secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after initial network log-in" - only if risk assessment indicates need

**Using DoD USG banner text verbatim for contractors:**
- "I actually dont recommend using this one for two reasons. First it is very USG specific. We are not talking about USG information systems here. We are talking about private information systems that handle USG information. So every mention of USG is actually beyond the scope of the authorities you possess in implementing a private information system." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
- "Second. It does not mention CUI. The requirement here is 'in accordance with applicable CUI rules.'" - Spock67

**Physical CUI stickers on laptops:**
- "I have elected NOT to put a CUI sticker on them" - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
- NARA CUI Marking Handbook (Page 23): "Equipment can be marked or labelled." - Optional, not mandated
- OPSEC considerations: "I would not put a sticker on them that says 'steal me please - sensitive gov info' either"

**CUI signs in all workplaces:**
- "We do NOT slap a CUI sticker on every laptop because of OPSEC considerations. We do not post CUI signs in workplaces (although we do mark our secure storage cabinets). Some have stated this is a requirement but I dont think that is supported in the regulation." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**Always-on-top DoD-style banner:**
- "The question was raised about the always-on-top banner that DoD uses being required" - Not required; login banner is sufficient

---

## Edge Cases

**Mobile devices:**
- "I don't think anyone does this for mobile devices" - Jake (Fellow)
- "I haven't heard of anyone doing either marking or banners for mobile devices" - cp333 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
- If mobile devices are kept CUI-free, the control is not applicable for that device class

**Printer areas:**
- "Also remember areas that can't display a banner or privacy notice like printer areas. Those must have a visual privacy notice displayed as well. Something stating that if CUI is printed then it must be handled according to company CUI policies is generally accepted" - 22billthecat
- Note: Another user questioned what control this derives from; no definitive response in thread

**Large user base with limited CUI access:**
- Challenge: "We have a large user base and only a small number of those access CUI"
- Option 1: Show banner to all users at login stating they "may have access to CUI"
- Option 2: Display banner at enclave/application entry point where CUI resides
- Option 3: Use system popup upon login for relevant users (group policy based)
- Management pushback noted: "confusing, intrusive and unnecessary for majority of users"

**CUI-Specified vs CUI-Basic notices:**
- Per FAQ Q37: "This requirement references the National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) Federal rule (32 CFR 2002) implementing its CUI program. It would apply if a specific type of CUI (i.e., information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to law, regulation or Governmentwide policy) requires such notices (e.g., before accessing or entering the data). This is not common."
- "The DoD has not promulgated any CUI 'specified' rules and says in 5200.48 essentially we will get to that later." - Spock67

**No CUI in environment yet:**
- "The CUI-Specified categories typically just require that you indicate that the system contains CUI. No need to specify the exact categories of CUI in the banner" - Liatris (Lead CCA)
- Generic notice is acceptable; no need to predict specific CUI types

**MS365 character limits:**
- "It's giving me a 1024 character limit" for Entra login banner
- Options: Use shortened text per STIGs ("I've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't.") or implement Terms of Use via Conditional Access with PDF attachment

## Evidence Examples

**Accepted:**
- Screenshot of login banner displayed before authentication
- Desktop wallpaper with privacy/security notice
- MDM enrollment notification with CUI reference
- Policy documents referenced in banner text

**Sample Banner Text (legally reviewed, contractor-appropriate):**
```
Use of this Information System (IS) constitutes consent to monitoring and the following:
- Communications and data stored on this IS are subject to routine monitoring and may be disclosed or used for any corporate authorized purposes
- Use of this IS is restricted to authorized corporate business purposes, and not-to-interfere personal activities when authorized by company policy
- Misuse of this IS, including any attempts to disable or subvert existing technical security controls, may be subject to adverse personnel actions up to and including employment termination, and may include criminal or civil penalties.
- This IS may contain CUI and should be handled IAW corporate Policy and Federal Regulation
```
*Source: Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor) - "This is my riff on several ones that had serious legal review."*

**Assessment Guide checklist elements (not mandatory, but useful inspiration):**
- information system usage may be monitored or recorded, and is subject to audit
- unauthorized use of the information systems is prohibited
- unauthorized use is subject to criminal and civil penalties
- use of the information system affirms consent to monitoring and recording
- the information system contains CUI with specific requirements imposed by the Department of Defense
- use of the information system may be subject to other specified requirements associated with certain types of CUI such as Export Controlled information

**Key policy document note:**
- 171A calls out "Privacy and security policies" as assessment object instead of AC policy - this may be the only control where the object policy doesn't match the control group

> "It could be 'Here there be CUI. Follow the AUP. Arrrrrgh'" - Jake (Fellow), illustrating flexibility in banner content

> "I would not put too much weight in to these [assessment objects]. They are direct copies from 53A and are intended to help assessor look for evidence. They are not requirements." - Alabaster
