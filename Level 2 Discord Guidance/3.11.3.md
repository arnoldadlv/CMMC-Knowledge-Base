# 3.11.3 - Expertise Overlay
**Control:** Remediate vulnerabilities in accordance with risk assessments.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.11.3[a] vulnerabilities are identified.
- 3.11.3[b] vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with risk assessments.

---

## Sufficient

### Evidence That Demonstrates Compliance
- **Two examples showing complete remediation lifecycle:** Vulnerability identified, ticketed/tracked, fixed, then verified as remediated (e.g., before/after scan results)
- **SSP commentary explaining risk acceptance criteria:** Document which risk levels trigger remediation vs. acceptance (e.g., "We accept the risk rating of our vul scanner. We risk accept level 1 and 2 risks, and remediate all risks 3-5 not deemed a false positive.")
- **Formal documented exceptions for legacy/EOL systems:** Written justification with rationale for enduring exceptions
- **Risk-based reclassification with investigation:** When vulnerability conditions don't apply (e.g., required port not open, config not enabled), document the investigation showing the means of exploitation is not applicable, then reclassify as informational/N/A

### Acceptable Approaches for Unsupported/Legacy Software
- **Specialized Assets (SA) classification** for devices with embedded unsupported OS (laser cutters, punch presses with Win7)
- **Enduring exception process** with formal documentation for software that cannot be updated without breaking functionality
- **Compensating controls** such as: blocked internet access, restricted VLAN, jump box access, controlled exterior network connections

---

## Insufficient

- **Spreadsheet alone without SSP commentary:** "Just the spreadsheet is probably not enough" - need policy documentation explaining remediation criteria
- **Ignoring all medium vulnerabilities:** "An org that only addresses Highs and ignores the others will probably not pass"
- **No investigation of applicability:** Must actually investigate whether vulnerability conditions apply to your system before dismissing

## Edge Cases

### Legacy/EOL Software with CVEs
**Scenario:** Manufacturing software requires older VC++ Redistributable that has reached EOL or has CVE. Updating breaks required software.

**Resolution:**
- Remediation decision process is ODP (Organizationally Defined Parameter) - you don't have to remediate every vulnerability
- Create enduring exception with formal documentation
- If there's a plan to fix: use temporary deficiency route
- If no plan to replace: formal isolated enduring exception in writing with justification and rationale
- Can mark finding to not show up in vulnerability scanner
- More scrutiny expected on CUIA vs. specialized assets

### Specialized Manufacturing Equipment (Win7)
**Scenario:** Laser cutters, punch presses with embedded PC running Win7, only LAN access (no internet).

**Resolution:**
- Classify as Specialized Assets (SA) if upgrading OS would break them
- Must be documented and "managed using the contractor's risk-based security policies, procedures, and practices"
- Recommended compensating controls: restricted VLAN, blocked internet access, jump box access

### Vulnerabilities Where Exploit Conditions Don't Apply
**Scenario:** Vulnerability requires specific port/config/module that isn't present in your environment.

**Resolution:**
- Conduct investigation to determine if exploitation conditions apply
- If conditions not present, reclassify as informational or N/A
- Document the investigation and rationale
- Patch not required if means of exploitation is not applicable

---

## Evidence Examples

### Recommended Evidence Package
1. **Two vulnerability remediation examples showing full lifecycle:**
   - Initial scan showing vulnerability identified
   - Ticket/tracking record
   - Remediation action taken
   - Follow-up scan showing vulnerability resolved

2. **SSP documentation including:**
   - Risk acceptance criteria (which severity levels require remediation vs. acceptance)
   - How false positives are handled
   - Criteria for evaluating vulnerability applicability

3. **For legacy/EOL systems:**
   - Enduring exception documentation with justification
   - Compensating controls implemented
   - Asset classification (SA if applicable)

## Key Quotes

> "3.11.3, 3.12.2, and 3.14.1 all have some overlap and some differences. I tend to keep them together for that reason. Definitely plug the new Risk Response requirement from Rev. 3 into the mix. Together, they result in a ramshackle vulnerability management process. Whether you found out about the vuln from scans, a vendor software update, or a controls assessment: all roads lead to a prioritized response with some performance benchmarks as a backstop."

> "I think just the spreadsheet is probably not enough though"
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "3.11.1 is the risk assessment. 3.11.3 is vulnerability remediation which usually take two examples from start to finish where you identified the vulnerability, did some ticketing/tracking, fixing, and then show it was fixed."
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "usually by showing two different scan results where it was identified and where it was gone from the report later after being fixed"
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Remediating vulnerabilities decision process is ODP. You don't have to remediate every vulnerability."
> -- MonkSecurity (CCP)

> "Also enduring exception. Formally document it with a process you create"
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "An org that only addresses Highs and ignores the others will probably not pass. The key is whether they are 'addressed' not necessarily mitigated."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "When a vulnerability is only a vulnerability if a certain condition is present (e.g., a specific port is open, a specific configuration setting is enabled, a specific module is installed), and you do a risk assessment and determine that condition is not present, you can reclassify that vulnerability as informational or N/A and you don't have to apply that patch."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Assuming you can't upgrade the OS without breaking them, they would qualify as Specialized Assets (SA). They have to be documented and 'managed using the contractor's risk-based security policies, procedures, and practices.' If they need to be on the LAN, then you just have to do the best you can to protect them. Blocking Internet access is good. Putting them in a restricted VLAN even better."
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "And if you look at the r3 ODPs you'll see that DoD defined timelines for addressing low, medium and high vulns under 3.11.2.b"
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "remediate highs within 30 days, moderates within 90 days, and lows within 180 days"
> -- nfaustino (referencing Rev 3 ODPs)
