# 3.14.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Identify, report, and correct system flaws in a timely manner.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- [a] the time within which to identify system flaws is specified
- [b] system flaws are identified within the specified time frame
- [c] the time within which to report system flaws is specified
- [d] system flaws are reported within the specified time frame
- [e] the time within which to correct system flaws is specified
- [f] system flaws are corrected within the specified time frame

**DIBCAC Status:** 3rd most "Other than Satisfied" requirement (per Amira Armond, C3PAO)

## Sufficient

### Evidence Accepted
- **Point-in-time vulnerability reports** - "Showing a point-in-time report of vulnerabilities is the most basic/common evidence" (Amira Armond, C3PAO)
- **Tickets or emails to patch team** - "Showing tickets or emails to the patch team saying 'fix this problem' are another common evidence" (Amira Armond, C3PAO)
- **Log sheet with date/time, reporter, recipient, and ticket number** - Confirmed acceptable "as long as you can show a link between vulnerabilities and that evidence, such as a process" (Amira Armond, C3PAO)
- **Spreadsheet tracking unremediated/remediated flaws** - "For my setup that's just a spreadsheet. One tab is unremediated flaws, and I just copy the row into a second tab once the flaw is remediated, so I have a record" (JB)
- **Patch management tool history** - "We can show evidence by going thru the history of our patch management system" (rafaAmd101)
- **Software update logs** - "Don't the software updates show in your logs?" (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- **Tool configuration showing scan frequency** - For [a]/[b]: "evidence that tool is configured to run checks every 7 days" (Uncouth, CCP)
- **Defined SLA for fixing flaws** - Required for [e] (Uncouth, CCP)
- **Using "Rolling" as approved version** - For continuously updating software like Chrome, listing "Rolling" in inventory is acceptable (John)

### Timeframe Approaches Accepted
- **Identify flaws within 7 days** - Tool configured to run checks every 7 days satisfies [a]/[b]
- **Report immediately upon automated discovery, within 1 business day manually** - Satisfies [c]/[d]
- **Weekly minimum reporting** - "add a statement to our policy that we report flaws at minimum weekly" (Matt Pierce)
- **Test ring 1 day after release, production 3 days after release** - For Windows Quality updates (John)
- **1 week remediation window** - "that person corrects certain selected flaws within one week of reporting" (rafaAmd101)

### Tools Discussed as Acceptable
- Defender Vulnerability Management (GCC-High E5)
- CIS-CAT Pro (for configuration flaws/CIS Benchmarks)
- STIG tools
- Intune/JAMF
- ManageEngine
- NinjaOne

## Insufficient

### Common Failure Modes
- **Missing "reporting" documentation** - "We were trending not met because we did not have a documentation reference to the frequency of reporting flaws. We discussed how we performed regular scanning of vulnerabilities. Then we discussed our time frames for remediation. We were found not to have answered the control because we didn't 'report' the scan results on a defined basis." (Matt Pierce - mock assessment finding)

- **Reading control too narrowly** - "Most people read the requirement as just the last assessment objective: [f] system flaws are corrected within the specified time frame. However, other objectives require you to specify timeframes for identifying flaws and reporting flaws, then show proof of identifying and reporting." (Amira Armond, C3PAO)

- **Missing link between vulnerabilities and tracking** - Evidence without demonstrable connection to vulnerability identification process is insufficient.

### Why Organizations Fail
1. Missing specified timeframes for identify/report/correct
2. No documented reporting step (even if same person identifies and patches)
3. Unable to demonstrate flaws are corrected within defined timeframes
4. Treating this as only a patching control (ignoring configuration flaws)

## Over-engineering

### Examples Identified
- **Monthly CAB approval for all patches before installation** - "This should meet compliance requirements, but to me, it's a bit of overkill... I'd like to see security patches applied automatically when available, not weeks later after undergoing a monthly review." (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)

- **Extensive pre-install review process** - A proposed 7-step CAB/FSO approval workflow was explicitly called out: "This is overkill. For OS patches we have a policy that Windows Quality updates are applied to test ring 1 day after release and production ring 3 days after release - No manual approvals required." (John)

### Right-Sizing Guidance
- "Remember, you own your change management process. The only changes that require approval are the ones that you deem require approval. If you align with ITIL it's going to take a very spicy assessor to balk at that." (John)
- OS patches and continuous-update apps (Chrome, etc.) can be treated as ITIL "standard changes" - no approval required.

## Edge Cases

### Single-Person IT Team
- **Problem:** "When a single person is in charge from start-to-finish, they may have trouble showing evidence that they 'reported' the flaws to themselves."
- **Solution:** "The normal solution is adding a reporting step to your process to document what patches are needed before you start patching. The list of flaws is never reviewed by anyone else, except as evidence you are reporting on schedule." (Amira Armond, C3PAO)

### Flaws vs. Vulnerabilities
- **Key clarification:** "Remember, flaws don't just mean vulnerabilities. You might have configuration flaws that need to be corrected." (scotty, CCP)
- **Also:** "Flaws may include more than just vulnerabilities (3.11.2 & 3.11.3)." - References to vulnerability scanning and security assessment controls.

### Unpatchable Systems
- **Scenario:** System cannot be patched because it breaks, and no alternate system available.
- **Solution:** "This is a good candidate for an enduring exception to policy and/or a multi-year POA&M. (Talk to a cybersecurity professional to plan this out, because it can burn you if done wrong.)" (Amira Armond, C3PAO)

### Customer-Mandated Software Versions
- **Question:** "If a system flaw is identified, reported, but not corrected because your employees are told the updated versions are not approved for use by the customer (government). Is an email with the list of approved software sufficient enough that I can have an indefinite correction date for those flaws?"
- **Discussion Status:** No definitive answer provided in thread.

### Automated Patching vs. Baseline/Authorization (3.4.1 Tension)
- **Problem:** Automated patch management may do major version updates without user notification, conflicting with baseline documentation requirements.
- **Solution:** List software as "version 3.x" (major version) so minor updates/patches can apply while matching allowed list. Or list "Rolling" for continuously updating software. (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA; John)

### Non-FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanners
- **Warning:** "beware of using non fedramp cloud services" for vulnerability scanning (Spock67, CCA)

## Evidence Examples

### For Each Assessment Objective
| AO | Policy Statement Example | Evidence Example |
|----|-------------------------|------------------|
| [a] | "We identify flaws within 7 days" | Tool configured to run checks every 7 days |
| [b] | (Same as [a]) | Scan reports showing regular execution |
| [c] | "Flaws are reported immediately upon automated discovery, within 1 business day manually" | Generated reports, email notifications, tickets |
| [d] | (Same as [c]) | Report history with timestamps |
| [e] | "Defined SLA for fixing flaws" | Policy document with remediation timeframes |
| [f] | (Evidence of [e]) | Tickets showing fix within SLA, patch history |

### Specific Examples Mentioned
- Vulnerability scan reports from Defender/vulnerability scanner
- Patch management tool history and reports
- Tickets showing flaw identification and remediation
- Email notifications to patch team
- Log sheet with date/time/reporter/recipient/ticket number
- Spreadsheet with unremediated/remediated tabs
- Daily Security Log entries for major CVEs
