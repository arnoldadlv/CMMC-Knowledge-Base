# 3.13.13 - Expertise Overlay
## Control and monitor the use of mobile code.

---

## Sufficient

**Control (3.13.13[a]):**
- Policy that states what mobile code is allowed and what is not allowed
- Allowing JavaScript on webpages via documented policy decision (exerting control by explicitly allowing)
- Prohibiting Flash, ActiveX, and Java plugins for web browsers on workstations
- Using Intune and Chrome Enterprise to restrict all but approved plug-ins
- Allowing a subset of users (e.g., developers) to execute specific languages while prohibiting others
- Using browser security tools (LayerX mentioned) to manage browser-based security

**Monitoring (3.13.13[b]):**
- Real-time scanning with device malware scanners that send alerts
- Advanced threat protection at firewall level that sends alerts when malicious websites visited
- Log reviews and checking alerts from malware tools (Malwarebytes mentioned) when mobile code like VBS, Java, ActiveX gets blocked/detected
- Anti-malware solution that monitors for unwanted/malicious mobile code
- Malwarebytes Browser Guard specifically mentioned - has setting to block malicious code and detection history section for monitoring

**Key Insight:** "you're exerting control by allowing something... you're also exerting control by denying it" - Uncouth, CCP. Control does not mean "locked down" - it means making deliberate decisions about what is/isn't permitted and documenting them.

## Insufficient

**Common Misunderstanding - NOT mobile code:**
- Applications running on mobile phones or other mobile devices (this is NOT what the control addresses)
- Users downloading, installing, and running unauthorized software (this is a different control)

**Assessor Observation:**
- "Mobile Code is one of the hardest requirements to explain as a consultant and one of the hardest to evaluate as an assessor" - CyberNorris, Lead CCA, C3PAO
- People confuse mobile code with mobile device apps
- People try to address it by saying "users aren't allowed to download, install and run unauthorized software" - this misses the point

## Over-engineering

**Discussed but corrected:**
- Thinking you need to have mobile code "locked down and tracked" - this is NOT the actual requirement
- The requirement is to control (make decisions about what's allowed) and monitor (track what happens)

No discussion found on specific over-engineering examples beyond the above clarification.

## Edge Cases

**Developer environments:**
- Q: "How are people handling developer tools and still keeping compliant?"
- A: Developers creating/executing mobile code with web developer tools enabled is acceptable IF:
  - You allow a subset of users to develop and execute specific languages (documented)
  - You prohibit what you don't allow
  - You prohibit malicious mobile code
  - You leverage anti-malware to monitor for unwanted/malicious code

**Browser choice:**
- Question raised about forcing Chrome Enterprise vs allowing Firefox/Edge - not conclusively answered

---

## Evidence Examples

**Policy evidence:**
- Mobile code policy stating what is allowed vs prohibited
- Documentation of all authorizations for mobile code use

**Technical controls:**
- Intune configuration restricting browser plug-ins
- Chrome Enterprise settings managing extensions
- Browser security tools (LayerX, Malwarebytes Browser Guard)
- Anti-malware configuration

**Monitoring evidence:**
- Malware scanner alerts/logs showing mobile code detection
- Firewall ATP alerts for malicious website visits
- Log review records
- Detection history from browser security tools

**Tools mentioned:**
- Malwarebytes + Malwarebytes Browser Guard
- ThreatLocker ("will control lots")
- LayerX browser security
- Intune
- Chrome Enterprise

## Key Quotes

**Definition clarity:**
> "Software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote systems, transmitted across a network, and executed on a local system without explicit installation or execution by the recipient." - itsallsimple (C3PAO, AOS-G)

> "Web browsers are universal mobile code users. HTML and JavaScript would be examples of Mobile Code" - itsallsimple

> "This is not applications running on your mobile phone or other mobile devices." - itsallsimple

**Mobile code technologies:**
> "Mobile code technologies include Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF, Flash animations, and VBScript." - Landon_NoVa (Fellow), citing CMMC assessment guide

**Understanding control:**
> "you're exerting control by allowing something... you're also exerting control by denying it... monitor and control - monitor what you do/don't allow, control what you do/don't allow" - Uncouth, CCP

> "'locked down and tracked' isn't the requirement." - Uncouth, CCP

**Practical implementation:**
> "monitor only malware? fine. define your solution here around your malware protection. cite what mobile code your malware engine scans" - Uncouth, CCP

**Assessor challenge:**
> "Mobile Code is one of the hardest requirements to explain as a consultant and one of the hardest to evaluate as an assessor... Mobile code is not clearly understood well enough to describe how it is being controlled and monitored." - CyberNorris, Lead CCA, C3PAO

**Teaching tip:**
> "Ask them how they prevent users from allowing JavaScript to run in a web page. Demonstrate JS that is running in a common web page." - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA
