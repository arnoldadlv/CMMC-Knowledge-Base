# 3.8.5 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Control access to media containing CUI and maintain accountability for media during transport outside of controlled areas.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.8.5[a] access to media containing CUI is controlled.
- 3.8.5[b] accountability for media containing CUI is maintained during transport outside of controlled areas.

## Sufficient

### Hybrid/Remote Worker Laptops
Per ace_rimmer (Fellow):
- Laptops given to employees that are regularly taken home on hybrid schedule is acceptable
- Key question: "How do you handle portable media?"

### Transport Protection Methods
Per user davidgirtenjr:
- Everything transported is encrypted
- If not encrypted, physical protections in place: opaque tape, double wrapped, sanitized address, locks
- Similar to classified environment procedures
- For international travel: signed Tools of the Trade form, IT ticket, VPN access enabled

### CUI Removable Media at Home
Per Alabaster:
- Can CUI removable media be used at a person's home? **Yes**
- When authorized users need removable media to store CUI:
  - [a] they ensure only authorized users have access per company policy
  - [b] the company accounts for the use of the media external to the controlled space

### Encryption Reduces Risk
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- "Encryption at rest is the single biggest way to pay down risk for WFH scenarios"
- Especially if you can restrict company-owned portable storage to company workstations (Bitlocker-to-go, etc.)

## Edge Cases

### Flying with CUI
Question about flying with CUI (paper drawings or prototypes in cardboard tube)

Response (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):
- The cardboard tube is your personal carry-on item and remains with you at all times
- **You can't check it** - must maintain accountability
- If TSA requests inspection, ask to do so in a private area
- "Generally, CUI can be inspected by anyone within TSA. Your primary goal is keeping it away from the **public's** prying eyes"
- TSA inspection is within "lawful government purpose"
- If CUI has special dissemination controls (NOFORN), confirm inspector meets criteria

### Physical Items as CUI
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- "Physical items aren't normally CUI, because they aren't information"
- The "I" in CUI is "information" not "item"
- Technical data representing the physical prototype is what's CUI

### Overlap with Other Controls
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- Taking CUI home on thumb drive is an alternate work site discussion (3.10.6)
- Creating controlled area at home is also 3.10.6
- Secure storage/control access at home is 3.8.1, 3.8.2
- If employees create controlled environment at home, CUI is only "transported outside of controlled areas" when in transit

### Backup Tapes Transport
Question about backup tapes containing CUI being transported to offsite storage

Response (ace_rimmer - Fellow):
- "Are they encrypted? That's your best option, then less concerns about transport or storage"

---

## Evidence Examples

- Media transport procedures
- Transport sheets/logs recording movement of CUI media
- Encryption configuration for portable storage devices
- International travel authorization process
- Policy for CUI media at alternate work sites
- Locked container/physical protection procedures for transport

## Key Quotes

> "Controls to maintain accountability for media during transport include locked containers... the requirement (3.8.5) is to: ...maintain accountability for media during transport **outside of controlled areas**... this is (quite literally) secure storage of portable media outside of a controlled area."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "Deciding whether or not users can take CUI home on a thumb drive is an alternate work site discussion (3.10.6). Making sure employees create a controlled area at their own home is also a 3.10.6 discussion."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "Encryption at rest is the single biggest way to pay down risk for WFH scenarios. Especially if you can restrict your company-owned portable storage devices to company workstations/laptops (Bitlocker-to-go, etc.)."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "The cardboard tube is your personal carry-on item (or stowed in it) and remains with you at all times. You can't check it."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow) on flying with CUI

> "Ask to do so in a private area. TSA can accommodate this, although it will add time to your screening process. Generally, CUI can be inspected by anyone within TSA. Your primary goal is keeping it away from the public's prying eyes."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow) on TSA inspection
