# 3.5.4 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Employ replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged and nonprivileged accounts.

---

## Sufficient

- **NTLMv2 + MFA (DUO/TOTP):** NTLMv2 with DUO 2FA for Windows-based CUI assets is considered sufficient. Time-based OTP as 2FA for VPN access with complex password enforcement also meets requirements.

- **Active Directory with Kerberos:** AD natively ensures replay-resistant mechanisms. Setting minimum authentication to NTLMv2 and disabling SMBv1 satisfies the control.

- **Time-bound MFA codes:** MFA solutions that require unique time-bound codes for each authentication attempt (rejecting reused codes until new ones generate) meet replay-resistance requirements.

- **DUO and SafeID tokens:** Commonly accepted MFA solutions for this control.

---

## Insufficient

No discussion found explicitly labeling specific implementations as insufficient.

---

## Over-engineering

- **Wireshark packet captures:** Using Wireshark to demonstrate Kerberos authentication process is considered over-engineering. One member asked if packet capture evidence was needed; consensus was strongly against it.

- **"I cannot imagine needing a Wireshark for ANYTHING in CMMC."** - This statement received agreement reactions from multiple community members including moderators.

---

## Edge Cases

- **GCC-High HSPD-12/CAC requirements:** A member raised concern about Microsoft's SSP stating customers must use HSPD-12 compliant (CAC-based) certificate authentication for M365 GCC-High. The resolution: This requirement applies to DoD instances. For CMMC, you are held to 800-171 rev2, not the cloud provider's CRM. TOTP-based authentication remains acceptable for CMMC compliance even in GCC-High environments.

- **CRM vs. 800-171:** "You can use CRM as a guide, but you are held to 800-171rev2a" - clarifying that FedRAMP Customer Responsibility Matrix requirements may be stricter than what CMMC actually requires.

---

## Evidence Examples

- **Sufficient:** Screenshot/configuration showing AD authentication settings (NTLMv2 minimum, SMBv1 disabled)

- **Sufficient:** MFA solution configuration showing time-bound unique code requirements

- **Over-engineered/Unnecessary:** Wireshark traces showing Kerberos authentication packets

**Sample SSP language (from community):**
> "Active Directory natively ensures that replay-resistant mechanisms are enforced. [Company] IT has enforced the minimum authentication mechanism as NTLMv2 and has disabled SMBv1 throughout the [Company] environment. Our [MFA solution] requires that every authentication attempt uses a unique time-bound code, and if a code has been used then it will be rejected until a new one is generated."
