# 3.13.15 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

**Source:** Cooey COE Discord - system-and-communications-protection channel

---

## Sufficient

- TLS 1.2 enforced for all devices and verified on VPN connections
- Using secure version of TLS for applicable communications
- Renewing certificates before expiration to ensure trust
- Policy requiring use of approved devices, approved browsers, and approved VPNs/networks
- For GCC High environments: Relying on CSP's CRM (Customer Responsibility Matrix) with customer responsibility being to use approved modern browsers
- Combination of technical controls (TLS enforcement) AND policy controls covering communication requirements

## Insufficient

No discussion found.

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **VPN and SFTP:** TLS is not always default - need to verify VPN, SFTP, and other non-browser communication types are covered (not just web browser traffic)
- **Unexpected communication channels:** Assessor caution: "keep an eye out for something that could pop up and does not fit the model" - watch for communication channels that don't fit the standard TLS/browser model
- **CSP shared responsibility:** For GCC High and Duo (or similar CSPs), the CRM covers much of this control, but customer still responsible for using approved modern browsers

## Evidence Examples

- Configuration showing TLS 1.2 enforcement on managed devices
- VPN configuration/testing showing TLS 1.2 in use
- Valid, non-expired certificates for websites
- Policy documentation requiring:
  - Use of approved devices
  - Use of approved browsers
  - Use of approved VPNs/networks
- CSP Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) documentation showing shared responsibility

## Key Quotes

> "They are hitting at protecting against MiTm attacks and having a trusted relationship at both ends of a communication. For example, using a secure version of TLS for applicable communications, renewing a certificate for your website before it expires to ensure trust to the visitor."

> "TLS is not always default and you could have other types of communication sessions; eg VPN, SFTP etc etc. I think there is a policy angle to this one as well as technical to try and cover all the bases"
> - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, Certified CMMC Professional)

> "Just keep an eye out for something that could pop up and does not fit the model."
> - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Both their CRMs cover this and our responsibility as per the crm is to use approved modern browsers."
