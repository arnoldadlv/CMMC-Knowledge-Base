# 3.3.6 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Provide audit record reduction and report generation to support on-demand analysis and reporting.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.3.6[a] an audit record reduction capability that supports on-demand analysis is provided.
- 3.3.6[b] a report generation capability that supports on-demand reporting is provided.

---

## Sufficient

### Azure Sentinel Implementation (Validated by C3PAO - Amira Armond)
- **Analytics rules** with ability to drill down to raw logs satisfies 3.3.6[a] (audit record reduction)
- **Almost any query** can count as a report for 3.3.6[b] - demonstrate you can run a query on-demand
- Workbooks combined with analytics rules (30-40 rules) generating incidents from suspicious events is acceptable
- Ingesting logs from: Windows, Linux, Mac devices, EDR, cloud systems, firewall

### What Assessors Look For
- Logs and reports that can answer questions during an investigation or for compliance (Jake - Fellow)
- Ability to support on-demand analysis and on-demand reporting
- The specific criteria/queries are defined by the OSC (Organization Seeking Certification), not mandated by assessors

### SPA Considerations for Commercial SIEM
- If using SIEM in commercial (non-GCC) environment, ensure it meets requirements of a Security Protection Asset (SPA)
- Must have measures in place to keep CUI out of log data
- Standard logs (access, modification, delete, events, alarms) should NOT contain CUI data

---

## Insufficient

### Workbooks Only
- "If you are only using workbooks you are missing a lot of functionality in Sentinel. The analytics rules that you can import (from each data connector) are awesome." - Amira Armond (C3PAO)

## Over-engineering

## Edge Cases

### CUI in Logs Debate
- **Question raised:** "How do you keep CUI out of logs?"
- **Expert response (Uncouth, CCP):** "Logs are things like access, modification, delete, events, alarms, etc. None of that should be CUI data."
- **Guidance:** Don't introduce CUI in the first place. Create events with metadata only: "possible PII exfil hostname username date/time/file/etc." - not the actual data content
- **Note:** PII is not necessarily CUI - separate consideration

### Scoping SIEM to Commercial Environment with Enclave (PreVeil example)
- Using PreVeil for CUI email/files while using Sentinel in commercial M365 for internal log reporting
- **Assessor caution (Glenda Snodgrass, Lead CCA):** "If you have measures in place to keep CUI out of the log data, I don't see a problem with this."
- **Warning (Spock67, CCA):** Some assessors take position that "it is connected to a CUI asset therefore it is CUI. CUI might get in there."
- **PreVeil guidance:** Turn off OneDrive syncing for PreVeil folders - this is "basically a requirement"

### Assessor Variance
- Assessor forum tends toward stricter interpretation: "it is connected to a CUI asset therefore it is CUI"
- **Advice:** "Choose wisely when shopping for a C3PAO. Hopefully this is the kind of thing that would be addressed in the initial screening process." - Glenda Snodgrass, Lead CCA

## Evidence Examples

### Sentinel-Based Evidence
- Screenshots/demonstration of analytics rules configuration
- Workbook reports for data connectors
- Unified audit logging from Security and Compliance Center
- Demonstration of on-demand query capability
- List of data connectors configured (firewall, Windows Server, Office 365, Azure activity/audit logs)

### Log Sources Mentioned
- Windows, Linux, Mac endpoints
- EDR solution
- Cloud systems
- Firewall
- Office 365 / M365

## Key Quotes

> "Many companies use Sentinel for this yes. For [a], the use of analytics rules and the ability to drill down to raw logs can work. For [b], almost any query can count as a report... So demonstrate that you can run a query on demand." - **Amira Armond, C3PAO (CMMCAudit.org)**

> "Basically you want to include logs and reports to answer any questions during an investigation, or for compliance." - **Jake (Fellow)**

> "Everything else is defined by the OSC...." - **Amira Armond, C3PAO** (regarding what criteria/queries to use)

> "Logs are things like access, modification, delete, events, alarms, etc. none of that should be CUI data" - **Uncouth, CCP**

> "Note that if you are only using workbooks you are missing a lot of functionality in Sentinel. The analytics rules that you can import (from each data connector) are awesome." - **Amira Armond, C3PAO**

> "I am aligned to that but I dont think the assessor forum is. They seem to be more on the 'it is connected to a CUI asset therefore it is CUI. CUI might get in there.' 'We are protecting the DoD's information....The DoD expects us too...'" - **Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor**

> "Once again, choose wisely when shopping for a C3PAO. Hopefully this is the kind of thing that would be addressed in the initial screening process." - **Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA**
