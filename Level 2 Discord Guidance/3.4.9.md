# 3.4.9 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Control and monitor user-installed software.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.4.9[a] - A policy for controlling the installation of software by users is established.
- 3.4.9[b] - Installation of software by users is controlled based on the established policy.
- 3.4.9[c] - Installation of software by users is monitored.

---

## Sufficient

**Policy + Technical Prevention + Monitoring Combination:**
- Policy stating users must not install software without IT permission (addresses [a])
- Non-privileged users do not have local admin rights to install software (addresses [b])
- Newly identified software compared against change control records to confirm approval (addresses [c])

**Blocklist Approach with Developer Flexibility:**
- Allow developers with local admin to install software from controlled repos
- Commit to robust monitoring strategy (reviewing software inventories for newly-introduced software)
- Use active change control process to retroactively approve added software when it meets organizational policies

**No User Installs Scenario:**
- Even if users cannot install software (admin-only), you still need monitoring
- Show that you have a rule/alert/report checking for user-installed software
- Empty results from monitoring still demonstrates compliance - "boom, monitored"

**Per DoD Guidance:**
- Policy/process of periodic examination of user accounts is acceptable
- Does not necessarily require IT configuration or software controls, though that is typical

---

## Insufficient

**Inventory-Only Approach (Corrected by RPO):**
- Using ConnectWise (or similar) to inventory software WITHOUT reviewing for blacklisted categories was deemed insufficient
- RPO recommendation: Must establish software blacklist review practices for end user devices and server infrastructure

**Missing Monitoring Component:**
- Thinking that preventing user installs (admin-only policy) eliminates the need for monitoring
- Assessor challenge: "How do you know they didn't install anything if you're not monitoring for that activity?"

## Over-engineering

No explicit over-engineering examples discussed in this channel.

## Edge Cases

**Development Environments with Local Admin:**
- Engineers/developers who need local admin rights and flexibility to install tools
- Most tools come from controlled repos (GOOD)
- Some tools installed without advance approval (acceptable with proper monitoring)
- Solution: Monitor for newly-introduced software + retroactive change control approval
- Expert advice: Try to eliminate email and general web browsing on dev machines - "a compromised dev endpoint is an attacker's dream come true"
- Dev environments can have more open approach; NOT recommended for general users

**Air-Gapped Environments:**
- Internal-only email and web reduces risk
- Engineering may have more install flexibility than general users who are locked down

---

## Evidence Examples

**Acceptable Evidence Discussed:**
- Software inventory tool reports (ConnectWise mentioned)
- Change control records showing software approvals
- Blacklist review documentation
- Log rules/alerts for software installation monitoring
- Reports showing no unauthorized user-installed software (empty results acceptable)
- Policy documentation requiring IT permission for installs

**Per DoD Guidance (2018 Document):**
- METHOD(S) TO IMPLEMENT: Policy/Process, IT Configuration; Software
- "This requirement is necessary to protect the overall system processing CUI. It is not about software used to actually process CUI."

## Key Quotes

**rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP):**
> "3.4.9[a] users must not install software w/o permission from IT
> 3.4.9[b] non-privileged users do not have local permission to install software
> 3.4.9[c] newly identified software (perhaps found in ConnectWise reports) are compared with change control records to confirm they are approved."

**rybo on blocklist approach:**
> "This requirement is only focused on the installation of software, not whether it can execute/run. If you adopt a blocklisting approach (see 3.4.8), and allow devs to install their own apps: you're simply committing to a more robust monitoring strategy (reviewing software inventories for newly-introduced software) and a more active change control process (retroactively approving added software when it meets organizational policies)."

**rybo on dev security:**
> "I would not recommend allowing this open of an approach outside of development environments (general users). I would also try (try) to eliminate the use of email and general web browsing on dev machines, since a compromised dev endpoint is an attacker's dream come true."

**Uncouth (CCP, Fellow) on monitoring necessity:**
> "how do you know they didn't install anything if you're not monitoring for that activity?"

**Uncouth on evidence for no-install environments:**
> "yep, show that you check for it, you have a rule/alert/report that tells you there's no results, boom, monitored"

**rybo on future requirements:**
> "Software bill of material (SBOM) requirements are coming our way soon enough. Knowing which libraries, tools, and standalone software compiled code depends on (through monitoring, change control, and documentation) is a useful skill to strengthen and refine before those requirements hit."
