# 3.1.22 - Expertise Overlay

Control CUI posted or processed on publicly accessible systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.22[a] individuals authorized to post or process information on publicly accessible systems are identified
- 3.1.22[b] procedures to ensure CUI is not posted or processed on publicly accessible systems are identified
- 3.1.22[c] a review process is in place prior to posting of any content to publicly accessible systems
- 3.1.22[d] content on publicly accessible systems is reviewed to ensure that it does not include CUI
- 3.1.22[e] mechanisms are in place to remove and address improper posting of CUI

---

## Sufficient

**Policy and Procedure Approach:**
- Written procedure defining who can post to publicly accessible systems (marketing, comms team)
- Pre-publication review process documented for all text and visual content
- Periodic review of posted content at defined frequency (annual acceptable, monthly/quarterly preferred)
- Documented process for responding to CUI spillage if discovered
- Training for web personnel on CUI identification

**Evidence for Objective [d] - Post-Publication Review:**
- Annual written review by CTO/designated reviewer stating no CUI found on website
- Sign-off record showing who did the review and when
- Excel spreadsheet tracking reviews with versioning and audit trail

**Review Frequencies That Passed:**
- "Annually at minimum" passed DIBCAC audit (Jake/ace_rimmer)
- Pre-posting review PLUS annual full site review is sufficient
- Visual Ping or similar change-detection tools triggering review only for changed pages (rybo approach)

**Scope Clarification:**
- Applies to **organizationally-owned** publicly accessible systems (company website, company social media pages)
- Personal employee social media NOT in scope for pre-posting review requirements
- Cloud-hosted websites (GoDaddy, Akamai) are typically NOT CUI assets in your system boundary
- For enclaves (universities): restrict review to scoped environment; other controls prevent unauthorized access to CUI

**Policy Placement Flexibility:**
- Can include in Media Protection Policy
- Can include in AUP (Acceptable Use Policy)
- Can be standalone social media/website policy
- Any approach acceptable as long as traceable during assessment

---

## Insufficient

**Policy-Only Without Periodic Review:**
- DIBCAC specifically required regular review of website, not just policies and procedures (Jake/ace_rimmer experience)
- "Show me your social media policy" alone may not satisfy all assessors

**Same Person Posting and Reviewing:**
- Certified assessor (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA): "I don't know any assessors that would be happy with one person doing both the review and the posting"
- Separation of duties between poster and reviewer is expected

**No Documentation of Pre-Publication Review:**
- Objective [c] requires "a review process is in place prior to posting"
- Must have evidence that review happens before content goes live
- Training alone without documented pre-review process may not satisfy [c]

**Reviewing Only After Posting:**
- Visual Ping approach only satisfies [d], NOT [c]
- Must have BOTH pre-publication review AND post-publication review processes

---

## Over-engineering

**Documenting Every Single Post:**
- Not required to document review for every piece of data posted
- Review as part of publishing process is sufficient if consistently followed
- Simple Excel sheet with audit trail is adequate; nothing elaborate needed

**Monitoring All Employee Personal Social Media:**
- Not required by this control
- Personal social media handling addressed through training (3.2.1) and Rules of Behavior (PL-4 NFO)
- "Are you then required to monitor your employees on LinkedIn?" - No (Jake/ace_rimmer)

**Excessive Review Frequency:**
- No requirement for more than annual reviews for static websites
- Quarterly/monthly helpful but not required

**Reviewing Entire Large Domain:**
- University example: 300,000 people can post to university.edu
- Restrict review to scoped environment only; other controls prevent unauthorized CUI access (Glenda/Lead CCA)

---

## Edge Cases

**Micro Companies (3 People):**
- One person doing both posting and reviewing may be acceptable if no stated separation of duties requirement
- Certified assessor (Spock67): "There is no stated requirement for separation of duties between posting and reviewing. Would be good if those were separated but I don't think I would give a Not Met if they were not."

**Static Websites with Rare Updates:**
- CTO reviewing everything is acceptable for mostly static websites
- Simpler approach appropriate when site changes infrequently

**Third-Party Social Media Platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook):**
- Company official pages: apply pre-posting review process
- Personal employee accounts: NOT in scope for this control
- If employee posts CUI to personal social media: handle as incident, but pre-review requirements don't apply

**FCI vs. CUI:**
- CMMC L2 Assessment Guide says FCI; NIST 800-171 says CUI
- This is a Level 1 control; FCI is in scope
- CUI is FCI, but not all FCI is CUI
- Policies should address both CUI and FCI

**Scoped-Out Email:**
- If you scoped out email (no CUI in emails), you still need a process for unintended disclosures in email
- Same logic applies: process to prevent AND respond to unintended disclosures

**Website Hosted Outside CUI Network:**
- This is a policy/process control, not a technical control
- Doesn't matter where posting is hosted
- If company has read/write/execute permissions on a website, that's a publicly accessible system under this control

---

## Evidence Examples

**For Objective [a] - Authorized Posters:**
- Website/Social Media Approval List documenting who can post
- Written authorization from IT Analyst/COO/designee before granting posting access

**For Objective [c] - Pre-Publication Review:**
- Documented pre-publication review process
- Training records for web personnel on CUI identification
- SharePoint/ticketing system tracking content approval workflow
- Git merge requests or comments showing review before publishing

**For Objective [d] - Post-Publication Review:**
- Annual (or more frequent) written attestation from CTO/reviewer stating no CUI found
- Excel spreadsheet with: what was posted, who reviewed it, when reviewed, when periodic review conducted
- Visual Ping alerts with subsequent review documentation

**For Objective [e] - Incident Response:**
- CUI spillage/incident response procedure
- Disciplinary actions for security violations
- Process to request removal and report incident

**Acceptable Formats:**
- Simple Excel sheet with versioning and audit trail
- SharePoint tracking
- Git/GitLab merge requests with comments
- Written attestation documents

## Key Quotes

**On Control Scope:**
> "publicly accessible systems are probably going to not be CUI assets. Especially if it's cloud hosted and not part of your enterprise like a godaddy or akamai hosted." - Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "This is basically a process to prevent and respond to unintended disclosures of CUI on your publicly accessible systems, yes those systems aren't technically CUI assets in your system boundary." - Jeff Baldwin

> "I think this control was written at a time when people actually had a website in their DMZ but I don't think very many do that anymore" - Jeff Baldwin

**On Sufficiency:**
> "pretty much just spend an hour of your life writing the procedure and have a periodic check of the website and then move on with your life" - Jeff Baldwin

> "nobody is going to go this in depth with this practice, they will just say show me your social media policy and your posting to websites policy? ok looks good, moving on" - Jeff Baldwin

**On DIBCAC Expectations:**
> "DIBCAC wasn't happy enough with policies and procedures - they required a regular review of the website. Dumb af." - Jake (Fellow, passed DIBCAC)

> "We set annual as our review time" - Jake
> "Source: Passed DIBCAC audit after doing this" - Jake

**On Separation of Duties:**
> "I don't know any assessors that would be happy with one person doing both the review and the posting. Spreadsheet is fine for tracking. Nothing elaborate needed." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "There is no stated requirement for separation of duties between posting and reviewing. Would be good if those were separated but I don't think I would give a Not Met if they were not." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On Review Frequency:**
> "I am a big fan of at least annually so if you do it every 10 months you win but if you end up doing every 11 because you missed it then you are still within policy" - Jeff Baldwin

> "It's up to you to define frequencies in r2. For CMMC, most everything should be done at least annually. Depending on your size, some assessors will frown at some things being done only annually." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On Pre vs. Post Review:**
> "I like to think of this in two parts. Before and After posting actions. [a]-[c] are before posting. While [d] and [e] are reactive after posting." - Alabaster

**On Scope for Enclaves:**
> "I'd restrict it to your scoped environment. Other controls prevent those 300,000 people from having access to CUI that they could improperly post." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On Control Type:**
> "this is a policy and process control, not a technical control. So it does not matter where the posting is hosted. If you can read, write, and execute permissions on a website as a company, then that would be publicly posted." - Alabaster

**On Assessment Approach:**
> "From an overall assessment perspective, the process will be defined by your company's policies. As assessors, we focus on the principle of 'say what you do,' as outlined in your policies, processes, and documents, and then verify it through 'do what you say' using tests, demonstrations, and interviews." - Alabaster
