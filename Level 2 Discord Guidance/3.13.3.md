# 3.13.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Separate user functionality from system management functionality.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.13.3[a] user functionality is identified
- 3.13.3[b] system management functionality is identified
- 3.13.3[c] user functionality is separated from system management functionality

---

## Sufficient

### The Power of Definition
Organizations can define what constitutes "privileged" vs "user" functionality. The key is having clear, documented definitions.

**Acceptable approaches discussed:**
- Define "privileged accounts" as domain admin accounts only (not local admin)
- Define "system management functionality" as Domain Admin functionality
- Define "user functionality" as Microsoft User account functionality
- Point to account type as evidence of separation
- Use logical separation via strong access control methods (most common approach)
- Use VLANs or network separation for admin functions

**For developers needing local admin:**
- Grant local admin via documented risk exception process
- Require supervisor and chief security officer approval
- Log in risk exception register
- Implement policy-level controls on what local admins can/cannot do
- Set up SIEM alerts to detect policy violations (e.g., disabling security agents)

### Evidence for 3.13.3[c]
- Account type documentation showing separation
- Microsoft User account functionality definition for users
- Domain Admin functionality definition for system management
- Screenshots/demos showing normal users cannot execute system management functions

## Insufficient

### Vague Policy Language
Example of NOT MET language for 3.13.3[a]:
> "Company employees are assigned user accounts allowing them to utilize our technology solutions. Company employs the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) with all accounts and users will only be permitted access to the technologies, data, records, sites, solutions that are required to perform their daily activities."

**Why insufficient:** Too broad. Does not specifically identify what constitutes "user functionality" vs "system management functionality." Does not provide enough to demonstrate separation. Rated as "moderate to high assessment risk" in mock assessment.

## Over-engineering

### Jump Boxes Not Required
While the control discusses jump boxes as an example, this is NOT required. Most organizations achieve compliance through logical separation using strong access control methods rather than physical/network separation.

### PAM Systems
A PAM (Privileged Access Management) system for checking out elevated privileges is mentioned as a "nice to have" for the roadmap but is NOT required for compliance.

## Edge Cases

### Local Admin Rights for Developers
**Debated scenario:** Can local admin be defined as non-privileged for certain roles (developers, engineers)?

**Resolution from Certified Assessors:**
- YES - You can define "security-relevant functions" and "privileged access" for your organization
- Local admin on workstations can be treated differently than local admin on servers
- Requires documented risk exception with appropriate approvals
- Must have compensating controls (SIEM alerts, policy prohibitions)
- One assessor initially disagreed but was convinced by the "power of definition" argument

**Key insight from Lead CCA:** "See that's the security assessor in me having to step back and remember to assess only to the CMMC standard."

### Micro Companies (3 people)
- Concern raised about having multiple admin levels in very small organizations
- Suggested to ask C3PAOs during interviews if they have assessed similar-sized companies
- Related concern about 3.3.9 (log access) for micro companies with only 2 privileged users

### Relationship to Other Controls
- Control is closely related to 3.1.2 (transaction types) and 3.1.5 (privileged accounts)
- If granting local admin to developers, need separate accounts for privileged vs non-privileged work for 3.1.5 compliance
- Need at least one admin without access to logging solution per 3.3.9

## Evidence Examples

**Discussed evidence types:**
- Account type documentation (User vs Domain Admin)
- Definition document listing user functionality (internal appendix)
- Definition document listing system management functionality (internal appendix)
- Access control configurations showing separation
- Risk exception log (for cases like developers with local admin)
- Policy documentation on what local admins can/cannot do
- SIEM alerts for detecting policy violations
- Live demonstration in Teams meeting showing normal users cannot perform system management functions

## Key Quotes

**On the power of definition:**
> "I will side with swxington. You get to define privileged accounts. Another case of using the power of definition." - Spock67 (CCA)

> "You get to define what those are... So define them as things requiring domain admin not local admin for example" - Spock67 (CCA)

**On local admin concerns:**
> "I don't see how you can define local admin as not privileged. What controls could you put in place that local admin couldn't bypass?" - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "Local admin can install software locally. That's the one that always worries me most, and that's generally something ordinary users aren't permitted to do." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On resolving the debate:**
> "I can control that at the policy level. Normally I do this for developers who need local admin but are not on the security or IT teams. And yes when I give the children fire they burn themselves." - Spock67 (CCA)

> "Okay, you convinced me... See that's the security assessor in me having to step back and remember to assess only to the CMMC standard. Thanks for the reminder!" - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On separation approaches:**
> "This can be accomplished using separation like VLANs or logical separation using strong access control methods. Most orgs go with the latter option." - Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On least privilege approach:**
> "I 'identify' privileged accounts as domain admin accounts. Everyone gets a user account. For a limited set of specific users (developers really in my case) we grant local admin to them. I put this in our risk exception log... The standard does not say that no one can be a local admin. It says that we have to employ the principal of least privilege. We are." - Spock67 (CCA)
