# 3.5.6 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Disable identifiers after a defined period of inactivity.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.5.6[a] a period of inactivity after which an identifier is disabled is defined.
- 3.5.6[b] identifiers are disabled after the defined period of inactivity.

---

## Sufficient

No discussion found explicitly confirming what is sufficient. However, the following was implied as acceptable:
- Disabling access to MFA/SSO tool after 30 days of inactivity was mentioned as a current practice (not explicitly validated as sufficient)
- Focus should be on **user accounts** - a Certified CMMC Professional stated: "Stick to user accounts"

## Insufficient

No explicit examples of insufficient implementations discussed.

## Over-engineering

**Scope creep concerns raised:**
- A user asked if the control should apply to:
  - Computer accounts in AD
  - Issued-but-unused key cards
  - Anything other than user accounts
- Response from CCP (Uncouth): "Stick to user accounts" - implying that extending to computer accounts, key cards, etc. may be over-engineering

## Edge Cases

**Mobile devices with CUI access:**
- Question raised: Do smartphones with access to CUI systems require identifier disabling?
- Concern: If CUI can be downloaded to device files (e.g., offline work on Google Drive), the device may be in scope
- Issue raised: Users on leave of absence (e.g., maternity leave) - how to re-enable access if all identifiers are disabled?

**Suggested approaches for leave of absence:**
- Certified CMMC Assessor (Spock67): "If a corporate device, and leave of absence (pregnancy) I would just suspend the account and leave the covered device on inventory. If departing the company then retrieve it or wipe remotely."

**De-scoping consideration:**
- One user suggested de-scoping smartphones from the CUI environment entirely to avoid these complications, but this was rejected by business stakeholders

## Evidence Examples

No specific evidence artifacts were explicitly discussed or validated in this thread.

**Implied evidence needs based on discussion:**
- Policy defining the inactivity period
- Technical configuration showing automatic disabling of user accounts after defined period

## Key Quotes

> *[Challenging assumption that disabled accounts create a problem - if account is disabled, CUI access should already be blocked]*

## Discussion Summary

This thread had limited discussion (8 messages total). The primary topics were:
1. **Scope clarification** - Control focuses on user accounts, not computer accounts or physical access cards
2. **Mobile device considerations** - If phones can store CUI locally, they may be in scope, creating complications for leave-of-absence scenarios
3. **Leave of absence handling** - Suspend account but retain device on inventory; re-enable when employee returns

**Notable gap:** No specific timeframe recommendations were discussed (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days). One user mentioned using 30 days for their MFA/SSO tool but this was not validated or critiqued by assessors.
