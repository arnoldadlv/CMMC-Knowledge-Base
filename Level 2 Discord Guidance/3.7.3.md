# 3.7.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Ensure equipment removed for off-site maintenance is sanitized of any CUI.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.7.3 equipment to be removed from organizational spaces for off-site maintenance is sanitized of any CUI.

---

## Sufficient

### Sanitization Required Before Off-Site Maintenance
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- The requirement is to sanitize equipment - logical access controls are not a substitute
- "That would not cut it as an alternate implementation either. The requirement is to sanitize it."
- Laptop definitely qualifies as equipment
- "Generally in maintenance sense, whoever is working on it has access to the full hard drive regardless of the access control for individual accounts"

### AutoPilot Reset for Cloud-Managed Laptops
- For Intune-managed laptops, an AutoPilot reset would satisfy the sanitization requirement before sending off for maintenance

---

## Insufficient

### MFA/Logical Access Controls as Compensating Controls
Per Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor):
- "There is no such thing as a compensating control in the CMMC world"
- Never tell the auditor you are using a compensating control without DoD CIO's explicit permission
- Logical and physical access controls (MFA into device) are NOT adequate substitutes for sanitization
- You could have an "alternative implementation of the security requirement" but not a "compensating control"

## Edge Cases

### Remote Workers and Hired Technicians
Question: "If our workers are remote and we hire a tech to fix an employee's machine in front of the employee, is that considered off-site?"

Response (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):
- This relates to 3.7.6 - Does the remote employee possess the required technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of the hired tech who does not possess the required access authorizations for CUI?
- The employee supervision aspect becomes key

### BYOD Phones and "Equipment" Definition
Question raised about how BYOD phones play into this requirement.

Response (Spock67 - Certified CMMC Assessor):
- The AG states this applies to "any system component"
- 800-53 includes peripherals such as copiers and scanners
- Laptops definitely qualify as equipment

---

## Evidence Examples

- Sanitization procedures for equipment going off-site
- AutoPilot reset or wipe logs for cloud-managed devices
- Documentation of sanitization performed before off-site maintenance
- Policy prohibiting off-site maintenance of unsanitized equipment

## Key Quotes

> "There is no such thing as a compensating control in the CMMC world. Just be aware. Never ever tell the auditor (or the DoD) you are using a compensating control without the DoD CIO's explicit permission (which you will not get unless you are Microsoft or a super major...). You could have an alternative implementation of the security requirement..."
