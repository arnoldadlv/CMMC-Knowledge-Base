# 3.1.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Limit system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.2[a]: The types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute are defined.
- 3.1.2[b]: System access is limited to the defined types of transactions and functions for authorized users.

---

## Sufficient

- **Spreadsheet documenting user types and permitted functions**: A spreadsheet listing system user types (e.g., guest, default, admin, HR) and the functions each type can perform was confirmed as acceptable for 3.1.2[a]. (Confirmed by Uncouth, CCP - Fellow)

- **M365 roles for RBAC**: Using M365 built-in roles for role-based access control is a valid approach, though evidence requirements were not fully resolved in discussion.

- **Small org without Active Directory**: For small organizations (4 people/devices), using local Windows admin vs. standard user designations, combined with application control (e.g., ThreatLocker) and limiting CUI access to specific application accounts (e.g., PreVeil) was deemed acceptable by a Lead CCA. (Confirmed by Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)

- **Role-based limitations on system/application access**: Limiting users to only information systems, roles, or applications needed for their responsibilities. Examples: Not everyone needs ERP or accounting software access; software developers limited from HR database access.

- **CRUD function assignments**: Common types of functions to define and limit are create, read, update, and delete (per CMMC L2 Assessment Guide).

---

## Insufficient

- **COPE model with unrestricted personal software downloads**: Allowing users to download programs for personal use creates problems justifying CM controls, particularly "least functionality" (3.4.7). One participant noted this kicks compliance issues to other controls (3.1.20 for external connections, 3.13.13 for mobile code).

- **Personal use without clear limitations on official business**: Simply stating personal use is allowed, without mandating that personal connections/apps cannot be used for official duties or access official data, is problematic.

---

## Over-engineering

- **Requiring Active Directory for small organizations**: AD is not required. Small orgs can use local Windows user types (admin vs. standard) combined with application-level controls and documented access definitions.

- **Banning all personal use of 800-171 systems**: Using Gmail, YouTube, Spotify, etc. is considered normal for 800-171 computers. You have flexibility to define what you limit. The control is about defining and enforcing those limits, not eliminating all non-work activity.

---

## Edge Cases

### Corporate-Owned Personally Enabled (COPE) Model
**Scenario:** Startup environment where users want personal apps (Spotify, gaming, classwork) on corporate devices while handling CUI.

**Reasoning:** This is defensible but introduces significant audit risk across multiple controls:
- Must distinguish between personal use and official business in policy
- Personal connections/apps must not have access to official data or be used for official duties
- Requires software denylist for prohibited applications
- Connections must be identified through monitoring
- Creates challenges with 3.1.20 (external connections must be "identified, verified, controlled, limited")
- Creates challenges with 3.13.13 (mobile code must be "controlled and monitored")
- Creates challenges with 3.4.7 (least functionality - difficult to justify with COPE)

**Approach discussed:** Mandate only explicitly approved software/vendors/connections for business duties; identify connections through monitoring; verify whether allowed for official business. Document this as accepted risk with management approval.

### Web-based Personal Applications
**Scenario:** Allowing Spotify web player instead of installed app.

**Reasoning:** This "kicks the can down the road" to other controls rather than resolving access limitation questions. Still must address whether the connection is identified/verified/controlled/limited (3.1.20) and whether the mobile code is controlled/monitored (3.13.13).

## Evidence Examples

- **User type/function matrix spreadsheet**: Document listing user types (guest, default, admin, HR, etc.) and functions each can perform - satisfies 3.1.2[a]

- **Technical implementation documentation**: Screenshots or configuration exports showing how restrictions are technically enforced - satisfies 3.1.2[b]

- **M365 role assignment screenshots**: Screenshots of accounts with assigned roles (though noted as possibly "too easy" - fuller context of role definitions recommended)

- **Application control configuration**: ThreatLocker or similar tool showing application restrictions per user type

- **Access control policy with COPE provisions**: Policy language defining what personal use is authorized, rules around official vs. personal use, prohibition on using personal accounts for duties

- **Software denylist**: List of prohibited applications/connections

## Topics Not Discussed

- Specific pass/fail scenarios from actual assessments
- Detailed evidence rejection scenarios
- Automated vs. manual enforcement mechanisms
- Frequency of access reviews
- Integration with identity governance tools
- Database-level or application-level transaction controls
- Network segmentation as implementation approach
