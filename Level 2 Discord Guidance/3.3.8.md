# 3.3.8 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.3.8[a] audit information is protected from unauthorized access
- 3.3.8[b] audit information is protected from unauthorized modification
- 3.3.8[c] audit information is protected from unauthorized deletion
- 3.3.8[d] audit logging tools are protected from unauthorized access
- 3.3.8[e] audit logging tools are protected from unauthorized modification
- 3.3.8[f] audit logging tools are protected from unauthorized deletion

## Sufficient

- **Access control for all three protection types (access, modification, deletion):** Point to access control mechanisms as the protection for all objectives. Different access levels can address different protection needs - generally different access for read vs. deletion, and no allowance for modification.
- **Role-based access with user assignment:** Show the security administrator role AND who has that role assigned. Example: "Security administrator: access to read and manage security configurations and reports" along with the specific admin(s) assigned to that role.
- **Single master admin for micro companies:** For a 3-person company, having only 1 master admin with access to audit logs (SIEM portal) is acceptable, with another authorized person receiving monthly log reports for review purposes.

## Edge Cases

- **Differentiating objectives [d], [e], and [f]:** A Lead CCA asked how to demonstrate these three objectives separately for audit logging tools. The accepted approach: access control addresses all three - showing only authorized users have access to the tools covers access [d], and the same access restrictions prevent unauthorized modification [e] and deletion [f].
- **Micro company staffing:** A 3-person company scenario was raised - having 1 master admin with SIEM portal access and a second person reviewing monthly log reports. This question was posed but no definitive assessor response was recorded in this thread.

---

## Evidence Examples

- Role definition showing "security administrator: access to read and manage security configurations and reports"
- User/admin assignment to the security administrator role
- SIEM portal access configuration
- Monthly log report distribution to authorized reviewers

## Key Quotes

> "Normally I point to access control for all three as protections. With generally different access for access and deletion and no allowance for modification."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "How does one demonstrate [e] and [f]? Merely showing that only authorized users have access [d] to the tools? How do these three differ?"
> -- Glenda R. Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

> "Well normally I would like the security administrator role to who has that role, but yes"
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor), confirming that showing the role definition plus who has the role assigned is acceptable evidence

> "i showed that config along with our admin with the role"
> -- SmooveOperator, confirming the evidence approach that was accepted
