# 3.2.3 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.2.3[a]: Potential indicators associated with insider threats are identified.
- 3.2.3[b]: Security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat is provided to managers and employees.

## Sufficient

- **CDSE Insider Threat Training (INT101)**: Free DoD training at https://www.cdse.edu/Training/eLearning/INT101/ is explicitly endorsed as "a great answer" for meeting this control by Certified CMMC Assessor Spock67.
- **Annual training cadence**: While not explicitly stated in assessment objectives, assessors interpret "periodically is implied" and CMMC defines periodic as "no more than annually." Assessor states: "As an assessor, we have generally taken the position that periodically is implied in this requirement."
- **Using NISPOM insider threat training for double duty**: For companies with FCL, annual NISPOM insider threat training can satisfy both NISPOM and CMMC requirements. Non-cleared CUI users just need to be included in the training.
- **No fixed number of indicators required**: When asked how many insider threat indicators should be listed, rybo (Moderator/Fellow) stated: "No wrong answers here."

## Insufficient

- **One-and-done training**: Assessor explicitly warns: "I think you are more than likely going to get a not-met if you treat it as one and done."
- **DoD Annual Security Refresher alone**: One user noted this training "only really includes Insider Threat training if you squint" - suggesting it may not be sufficient as the sole insider threat training.
- **Generic DoD training for 3.2.1**: Assessor Spock67 notes that while CDSE is great for 3.2.3 insider threat, "generic DoD training can never meet the 171 requirement" for 3.2.1 which requires organization-specific risks and policies.

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Sub-contractors with system access**: One user raised the organizational responsibility problem where FSO didn't want to track training for sub-contractors given system access, claiming it wasn't her NISPOM problem. The user argued everyone with building access at a facility FCL should be FSO's responsibility. Resolution was not reached - "still working that."
- **Contractors vs. DoD components**: DODI 5205.16 requires annual insider threat training for DoD Components, but contractors are not explicitly required to follow these annual requirements. However, assessors still expect annual cadence.
- **Non-cleared CUI personnel**: Companies with both cleared and non-cleared personnel handling CUI need to ensure non-cleared staff also receive insider threat training, not just cleared personnel covered by NISPOM.

## Evidence Examples

- **Training records**: Completion records from CDSE INT101 course
- **Training policy**: Documentation showing annual (not one-time) training requirement
- **Coverage documentation**: Records showing all personnel with CUI access (cleared and non-cleared) receive training

Note: Specific evidence artifacts were not extensively discussed in this channel.

> "I think you are more than likely going to get a not-met if you treat it as one and done." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "In my view, generic DoD training can never meet the 171 requirement... For insider threat though! They have a great answer" - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "So I think that annual insider threat for NISPOM can do double duty. The non cleared CUI people just need to get it too. In some cases FSOs have been hesitant to move outside the cleared only box." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)
