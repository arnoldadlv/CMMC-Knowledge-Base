# 3.5.11 - Expertise Overlay
## Control Text
Obscure feedback of authentication information.

---

## Sufficient

**Default password masking is sufficient:**
- Windows default behavior of showing dots/asterisks for password fields meets the requirement
- The "eyeball" reveal password button does NOT need to be disabled - passwords are "in general" obscured (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- Assessor explicitly stated: "Would I want to give a 'Not Met' on an Assessment because of that? No."

**Acceptable approaches (layered):**
- Procedure-based: Users follow procedure to not click "reveal password" when others are around
- Technical (Windows): Disable reveal button via CredentialsUI policy in Intune
- Password manager: Use one that doesn't allow users to see pasted passwords
- SSO: Reduces sign-on events, limiting exposure
- "Whatever is left can be handled through procedure" (rybo, Moderator/Fellow)

**Evidence example that received positive reaction:**
- Policy statement about obscuring authentication feedback during authentication process
- Screenshots from ALL system types showing password masking: OS, routers, switches, SSO, etc.

## Insufficient

## Over-engineering

**Disabling the Windows password reveal "eyeball" button:**
- Consensus: NOT required for compliance
- rybo noted: "Just prepare for the possibility of more account lockouts since people can't doublecheck their password"
- Technical reference provided for those who still want to do it: CredentialsUI Windows setting in Intune (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-credentialsui)

## Edge Cases

**Password reveal button ("eyeball") in Windows:**
- Question raised: Does the eyeball icon that lets users temporarily see their password violate the control?
- Answer: No - the control is about default behavior; optional user-initiated reveal is acceptable
- NIST 800-63B 5.1.1.2 actually RECOMMENDS offering an option to display the secret for usability (quoted by martian route)

**Applications beyond Windows:**
- Noted: "plenty of apps besides Windows where one cannot disable the View Password feature" (crashmaster)
- Solution: Handle via procedure since technical controls aren't universally available

---

## Evidence Examples

**Accepted evidence pattern:**
1. Policy statement: "The organization shall obscure the feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals"
2. Screenshots from ALL different types of systems showing password masking:
   - Operating systems
   - Routers
   - Switches
   - SSO portals
   - Any other authentication interfaces

## Key Quotes

> "No. I dont think you need to disable it to meet the compliance requirement. What do I base that on? Totally a judgement call on my part. Would I want to give a 'Not Met' on an Assessment because of that? No. In general the passwords are obscured."
> -- Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor, Certified CMMC Professional)

> "People can follow procedure and simply not click the 'reveal password' icon when others are around."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "The procedure is the best idea IMO because there are plenty of apps besides Windows where one cannot disable the View Password feature."
> -- crashmaster (Established Member, Consultant)

> "It's so rare to find a 'one size fits all' solution. A Windows setting may reduce the need for human processes, but that's only for the OS. A password manager that doesn't allow users to see pasted passwords can help a little more. SSO can reduce sign-on events even further. Whatever is left can be handled through procedure."
> -- rybo (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "800-63B 5.1.1.2: In order to assist the claimant in successfully entering a memorized secret, the verifier SHOULD offer an option to display the secret - rather than a series of dots or asterisks - until it is entered."
> -- martian route (citing NIST 800-63B as justification for password reveal being acceptable)
