## Sufficient

### Existing Hiring Policies May Be Sufficient
Per brianinca (based on conversation with Roy Blood):
- "Our current hiring policies, well documented, going forward may be sufficient"
- Roy Blood suggested the user was "overthinking it"
- Construction company example: drug screen EVERYONE for any/all positions pre-employment
- Safety incident = immediate drug screen

### Solid Onboarding Process Is Key
Per Tony Buenger:
- "If an organization has a solid screening and onboarding process in place then typically that is good enough"
- "That is all the requirement is asking for"
- One organization passed CMMC Model 1.0 Level 3 assessment with this approach
- Added "CUI hooks" to well-established screening and onboarding process
- HR updated procedures to identify those who would have direct access to CUI
- Those individuals identified as higher risk and provisioned with Secure Enclave accounts

### HR Knows Requirements
Per ace_rimmer (Fellow):
- "I always fall back to HR on these questions. They are the ones that should know what is required"
- For ITAR: must verify they are not foreign persons
- For financials/PII: may require criminal background check

## Insufficient

No discussion found.

## Over-engineering

### Screening Existing Long-Term Employees
Per brianinca:
- Requiring additional background screening for 30-year employees becoming CUI users is challenging
- Going to 20-year employees and saying "pass this screening before you keep working" is "a helluva hill to climb"
- Roy Blood suggested this was overthinking it

## Edge Cases

### Existing Employees vs. New Hires
Question: "How are people handling screening existing employees?"

Response (ace_rimmer - Fellow):
- "This is an HR question"
- Do they do any screening prior to hire?
- Any re-screening based on anything?
- Any screening when people are given access to CUI or is all screening done at hire time?

Response (brianinca based on Roy Blood guidance):
- Current hiring policies, well documented and applied going forward, may be sufficient
- No need to go back and re-screen 30-year veterans

### Third Parties (JV Partners, Subcontractors)
Question: "Best practices for making sure organization is covered for communication and collaboration with trusted third parties?"

Response (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):
- Newer version of 800-171 has several requirements related to third parties:
  - 3.9.3 External Personnel Security
  - 3.12.6 Information Exchange
  - 3.16.3 External System Services
  - 3.17.3 Supply Chain Controls and Processes

## Evidence Examples

- HR screening and onboarding procedures
- Pre-employment screening records (drug tests, background checks)
- Documentation identifying CUI-authorized personnel
- HR policy updates for CUI access identification
- Records of screening completion before CUI access granted
