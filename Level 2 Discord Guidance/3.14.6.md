# 3.14.6 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Monitor organizational systems, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.14.6[a] the system is monitored to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.
- 3.14.6[b] inbound communications traffic is monitored to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.
- 3.14.6[c] outbound communications traffic is monitored to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.

## Sufficient

- Firewall alerts configured for virus/attack/malware detection with email notifications to authorized personnel who monitor them - accepted as meeting the control when covering both inbound and outbound traffic
- SIEM with daily alerts on defined criteria (e.g., successful/unsuccessful VPN logins)
- Gateway antivirus, anti-spyware, and intrusion prevention services enabled for all zones (from/to each zone) with emailed alerts that are actively monitored
- IDS/IPS systems that provide monitoring capability
- The key requirement: someone must actually "monitor" (review/act on) the alerts - "reading the AOs wins once again"

## Insufficient

- Firewall alone without alerting - "The firewall blocks and allows traffic based on predefined rules. It does not monitor."
- Having tools generate alerts but no one reviewing them - emphasized question: "Who looks at, or 'monitors' them?"
- Content filter policies that only block without alerting/monitoring capability

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

**Single-person businesses:**
- Question raised about best approach: contracting with VCISO/SOC vs. buying automated monitoring tools with alerts
- Question about EDR tools licensed for single endpoint/user - no definitive answer provided

**No central network (distributed environment):**
- Scenario discussed: Individual laptops as "organizational systems" with no central network
- Small enclaves (Google Workspace, Azure VMs, individual laptops) - difficulty meeting objective (c) for outbound traffic monitoring acknowledged
- Question raised: Is Windows Defender sufficient for monitoring outbound traffic on laptops? - no definitive answer provided
- Clarifying question asked: What tools are used to share documents (to understand the environment and provide guidance)

**CUI handled on government systems:**
- Discussed scenario where 99% of work done on government systems, CUI never stored on laptops by policy, shared only via encrypted email or DOD SAFE
- Bifurcated Google Workspace subscriptions mentioned (one for normal business, one for accounts receiving CUI via email from .gov senders)

## Evidence Examples

- Firewall alert configurations showing virus/attack/malware detection rules
- SIEM daily alert reports (e.g., VPN login success/failure summaries)
- Content filter policy alert configurations
- Gateway security service configurations (antivirus, anti-spyware, IPS) enabled for all zones
- Evidence that authorized personnel receive and review alerts (email notifications)
- IDS/IPS configuration and alert evidence

> "The firewall blocks and allows traffic based on predefined rules. It does not monitor." - Uncouth, CCP (Certified CMMC Professional)

> "An IDS/IPS may." - Uncouth, CCP (on what provides monitoring capability)

> "Well there you go. You have alerts. Presumably you monitor them. If that's inbound and outbound, reading the AOs wins once again." - Uncouth, CCP

> "Think about what happens after those alerts are generated" - Uncouth, CCP

> "Who looks at, or 'monitors' them?" - Uncouth, CCP (emphasizing the human review component)
