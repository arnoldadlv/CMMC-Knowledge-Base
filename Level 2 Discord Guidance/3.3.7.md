# 3.3.7 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Provide a system capability that compares and synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative source to generate time stamps for audit records.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.3.7[a] internal system clocks are used to generate time stamps for audit records.
- 3.3.7[b] an authoritative source with which to compare and synchronize internal system clocks is specified.
- 3.3.7[c] internal system clocks used to generate time stamps for audit records are compared to and synchronized with the specified authoritative time source.

## Sufficient

- **NTP is the standard approach** - Confirmed by Lead CCA Glenda R. Snodgrass: "I think most folks use NTP."
- **Cloud-only environments (M365)**: NTP is already used by M365 for basic logs; no additional configuration typically required for cloud-native systems.
- **Showing timestamps align across systems**: If using multiple NTP sources, demonstrating that "the various sources are in fact synced, you will probably be okay" - but this is considered an assessment risk.
- **NIST Rev 3 simplification**: Per DoD ODPs, timestamps need to be UTC and within 1 second granularity. "1 second is a precision requirement on the time stamp." No accuracy requirement was found.

## Insufficient

- **Using multiple different authoritative time sources without justification**: The Assessment Objective says "an authoritative source" (singular). Using time.windows.com for Windows and pool.ntp.org for network gear without proving they sync is risky.
- **Cannot prove third-party sources are synchronized**: Lead CCA challenge: "How are you going to prove that those third party sources are synced with one another?"
- **Relying on assessor reasonableness**: "An assessor will need to be reasonable" - this is explicitly called out as "an assessment risk" by a Lead CCA.

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Meraki devices**: Cannot change the time source from what Meraki requires. Suggestion: use DHCP option 42 to pass authoritative NTP servers to other systems. No definitive resolution provided.
- **CSP time servers**: "You can't control time servers for CSPs. You can't control time servers in most virtual desktop setups." Assessors will need to be reasonable here with justification.
- **Third-party MFA (Duo)**: Time stamps set by time zone - unclear what authoritative source the vendor uses. Potential mismatch with organization's chosen NTP source. No resolution provided.
- **Singular vs. plural in documentation**: The Example in the Assessment Guide says "the same authoritative time server" (singular), but Potential Assessment Considerations mention "NTP Servers" (plural). This inconsistency creates ambiguity.
- **DoD-added content reliability**: "Both the Examples and the PACs were added by DoD, they didn't come from NIST. Some CCAs consider them authoritative because they are in the AG and some consider them unreliable because they didn't come from NIST."

## Evidence Examples

- **Configuration showing NTP source**: Screenshot/config showing which authoritative time server is configured
- **Timestamp alignment demonstration**: Evidence that timestamps across different systems (Windows, network gear) align with each other
- **DHCP Option 42 configuration**: For Meraki environments, showing NTP servers passed via DHCP
- **UTC timestamp format**: Audit records showing timestamps in UTC format
