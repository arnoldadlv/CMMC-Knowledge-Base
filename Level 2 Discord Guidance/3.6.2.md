# 3.6.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Track, document, and report incidents to designated officials and/or authorities both internal and external to the organization.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.6.2[a] incidents are tracked
- 3.6.2[b] incidents are documented
- 3.6.2[c] authorities to whom incidents are to be reported are identified
- 3.6.2[d] organizational officials to whom incidents are to be reported are identified
- 3.6.2[e] identified authorities are notified of incidents
- 3.6.2[f] identified organizational officials are notified of incidents

---

## Sufficient

**When no incidents have occurred requiring external reporting:**
- Document that you have not had an incident requiring reporting
- Create a statement such as: "This is our standard for reporting externally: X, Y, Z. There have been no incidents requiring reporting/meeting these standards since the initiation of this project"
- This approach is accepted by the community as valid for 3.6.2[e] compliance

**Incident category thresholds for reporting:**
- Define category thresholds using frameworks like CJSCM 6510.01B (Cyber Incident Handling Program) as a reference/example
- Create a "Reportable Incident" category that defines when external reporting is required based on DFARS 7012 and other applicable laws/regulations
- Example tiering: Cat 8 & 9 don't require reporting outside IT department; mid-tier requires elevated internal reporting; high-tier requires external reporting

---

## Insufficient

**Overly broad interpretation of reportable incidents:**
- Believing ALL malware detections must be reported to DoD is incorrect
- Blocked and quarantined malware that did not adversely affect the system does NOT require external reporting
- If malware was stopped before affecting CUI data, it can be ruled out as a reportable incident

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

**Blocked/Quarantined Malware:**
- Key question: Did the malware adversely affect the system, or did the system withstand the attempt?
- If you can prove the infection did not affect CUI data on the host(s), you should be able to rule it out as a reportable incident
- Malware samples can be submitted to DIBNET independently of an incident report (voluntary submission)

**Using Military References for Contractor Policies:**
- CJSCM 6510.01B is for Joint Chiefs, not sub-contractors
- However, it can still be used as an example/reference for structuring your incident categorization
- Build your own "Reportable Incident" category based on DFARS 7012 and applicable laws/regulations

**No Historical Incidents to Show as Evidence:**
- For 3.6.2[e], if no incidents have required external reporting, document this fact with your reporting standards
- You do NOT need actual incident reports to prove compliance - documented standards with a statement of no incidents meeting those thresholds is acceptable

---

## Evidence Examples

**Acceptable Evidence (discussed):**
- Documented incident categorization framework with reporting thresholds
- Incident tracking system/log (even if showing no reportable incidents)
- Written statement documenting: "No incidents requiring external reporting since [date]" with defined reporting criteria
- Defined list of authorities for external reporting (meeting 3.6.2[c])
- Defined list of internal officials for incident notification (meeting 3.6.2[d])

**Evidence of External Reporting (if applicable):**
- Records from DIBNET submissions
- 72-hour reporting documentation per DFARS 204.7301
