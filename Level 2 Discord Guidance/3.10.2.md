# 3.10.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Protect and monitor the physical facility and support infrastructure for organizational systems.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.10.2[a] the physical facility where organizational systems reside is protected
- 3.10.2[b] the support infrastructure for organizational systems is protected
- 3.10.2[c] the physical facility where organizational systems reside is monitored
- 3.10.2[d] the support infrastructure for organizational systems is monitored

## Sufficient

### Server Rooms / Data Centers
- Server rooms with card/badge access control - confirmed as acceptable (Jake: "They were happy with the server rooms being locked with card access")
- Locked server room with limited access list to only covered employees is acceptable
- Badge-controlled IDF/MDF rooms with alerting when unauthorized badge attempts occur

### Small Offices
- Small office (15 people) with monitored office space and port restriction enabled - acceptable for low-risk environments
- Locks and limited access covers most needs for small offices (Alabaster)
- Locked wiring closet checked by security OR electronic lock with central monitoring notification

### Monitoring Approaches
- Badge access logs qualify as monitoring (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA: "I say that the alerting counts as monitoring")
- Key sign-in/sign-out logs managed by technical lead satisfy both protection and monitoring (Jake confirmed)
- Reception desk monitoring during business hours + perimeter alarms after hours
- Alarms on perimeter entry/exit points sufficient for after-hours monitoring
- Ring cameras / home security cameras count as monitoring for WFH scenarios
- NIST definition of monitoring: "Continual checking, supervising, critically observing or determining the status in order to identify change from the performance level required or expected"

### Physical CUI Storage
- CUI in locked filing cabinet inside a locked office when unmanned - camera NOT required (Cuipacabra: "absolutely not necessary to point a camera/tripwire at CUI locked in a cabinet inside a locked room when unmanned")
- Locked drawer/closet for printed CUI - acceptable
- If file cabinet is locked, janitorial staff can access building - just need to arm alarm when leaving (rybo)

### Home Office
- Home office with manual lock/key on office door + servers/firewall in locked cabinet within office room + encrypted laptops - acceptable (received thumbs up and 100 reactions from multiple experts)

### Support Infrastructure
- Electrical rooms with key locks and key sign-in/sign-out log - acceptable
- For wiring through warehouse: general physical security of facility accepted by most assessors

---

## Insufficient

### Uncontrolled Access
- Firewall in common server room with no security or way to tell who is accessing - would trend "Not Met" (Spock67, Certified CMMC Assessor)
- Building supervisor or other tenants having access to network closets - common failure point (Amira Armond, C3PAO)

### Missing Concepts
- 802.1x is NOT relevant to requirement 3.10.2 - it does not provide physical security (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- Cannot substitute logical controls for physical security requirements

### Scope Gaps
- Regular network handling FCI must have its own self-assessment with physical security controls met - Level 1 requirements don't "magically disappear" when adding Level 2 VDI enclave (Spock67)

---

## Over-engineering

### Power Infrastructure
- Don't need to worry about power lines - "800-171 DGAF about your uptime/availability" and 800-53 controls for power, humidity, fire suppression were removed from 800-171 (rybo)
- No need to secure your power company or vet guards at the power plant (Spock67: "Even the most zealous of assessors I have not seen go that far")
- Control really applicable for "exposed shared infrastructure like in rented office space in a building with multiple tenants"

### Data Transmission
- Data transmission lines already covered in 3.13.8 (encrypt data in transit or encase in PDS)

### Cameras/Guards
- 24/7 camera monitoring not a hard requirement - "nowhere does it say you must have a camera system and alarm monitored 24/7" (Jake)
- Security guards not required for small offices with door locks and logged entry

### UPS/Redundant Power
- Redundant power supplies NOT a requirement - won't get "Not Met" for lacking redundant power or fail-closed door systems (rybo)
- Ask yourself: "Am I describing a requirement, or a risk?"

### Secret-Level Protections
- Requiring camera on CUI in locked cabinet in locked room is "creeping up on Secret level protections of CUI" - ridiculous for CUI (Cuipacabra)

---

## Edge Cases

### Demarc / Third-Party Access
- Demarc where landlord has keys: Assessors wanted to see it even though organization can't fully control access (Jake's experience with JVSA)
- Third-party physical security provider for servers with SPD: Rule is unclear but generally considered "psychotic" to require their CMMC certification
- Smart Hands service with SLA limiting their access - complexity acknowledged but not definitively ruled on

### WFH with Physical CUI
- WFH users with printed CUI: need locked container when not in use, consider Ring cameras/home security for monitoring
- Access logs for home office could be sent to corporate for periodic review
- If no physical CUI and printing prohibited: potentially pulls home out of scope, leaving only computer and user as CUI assets

### Power Loss Scenarios
- Key question: "Would losing power cause some of your security controls to fail?" and "Would that put confidentiality of CUI at risk?"
- If doors fail open when power lost AND locked doors required for CUI confidentiality, then confidentiality is lost
- If firewall goes down but CUI is on encrypted devices behind physical locks - confidentiality maintained

### VDI/Enclave Approach
- SCIF-like dedicated locked rooms for CUI processing: "Is this an approach that can pass an assessment?" - Yes, assessors have seen people taking this approach (Spock67)

### Leased Space
- Electrical panels in building common areas: Focus on supervised maintenance provisions - get notification if accessed without permission
- Building-managed keys for electrical rooms in leased space is acceptable

---

## Evidence Examples

### Acceptable Evidence (Discussed)
- Badge access logs for server rooms / restricted areas
- Door access logs with review documentation
- Key sign-in/sign-out logs for locked areas
- Alarm system records (perimeter entry/exit)
- Building security records (apartment/condo)
- Ring camera / home security footage (for WFH)
- USB-downloadable cabinet locks with CSV logs (CompX RegulatoR locks ~$100/lock suggested)

### What Assessors Want to See
- Physical access to demarc points
- How network closets, datacenters are protected
- Who has access and is it limited to covered employees
- Some means to know who accessed critical infrastructure

## Key Quotes

> "I've always interpreted 3.10.2[d] as 'badge the server room separately from the perimeter doors, throw a camera on it, and consider a door prop alarm.'" - **rybo** (Moderator, Fellow, MEP)

> "Considering that 800-171 DGAF about your uptime/availability, and considering that 800-53 controls for power, humidity, and fire suppression were taken out of 800-171: I wouldn't sweat the power lines." - **rybo**

> "nowhere does it say 'you must have a camera system and alarm monitored 24/7'" - **Jake** (Fellow)

> "Most companies go wrong because they let the building supervisor or other tenants in the building have access to network closets etc." - **Amira Armond** (C3PAO)

> "My expectation is for the OSC to define what counts as organizational systems and support for them, based on the criteria for what would be an Incident. Incidents = Unable to provide contract deliverables OR data spillage." - **Amira Armond** (C3PAO)

> "I always have to ask myself (when contemplating a what-if scenario): Am I describing a requirement, or a risk?" - **rybo**

> "I'd say absolutely not necessary to point a camera/tripwire at CUI locked in a cabinet inside a locked room when unmanned. I'm not an assessor, but have worked classified and unclas....and its ridiculous to me an assessor would require essentially creeping up on Secret level protections of CUI." - **Cuipacabra** (CCP)

> "I say that the alerting counts as monitoring." - **Glenda R. Snodgrass** (Lead CCA, Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "In general I think most assessors are accepting the general physical security of the facility in the case like the wiring going through the warehouse. I think this would trend not met when you have your firewall in a common server room with no security or way to tell who is accessing." - **Spock67** (Certified CMMC Assessor, Technology Vendor)

> "I mean we could take '3.10.2[b] the support infrastructure for organizational systems is protected' to be that you need to properly secure your power company. Vet the guards at the power plant etc etc. Even the most zealous of assessors I have not seen go that far." - **Spock67**

> "802.1x is not relevant to requirement 3.10.2" and "Nothing ever magically disappears." - **Glenda R. Snodgrass** (Lead CCA)

> "3.10.1 is how you limit access to authorized individuals, which includes how you know who is authorized and who is not. 3.10.2 is protect and monitor the facility (I'd say more specifically your in-scope spaces) and support infrastructure" - **Uncouth** (CCP, Fellow)

## Distinction: 3.10.1 vs 3.10.2

- **3.10.1**: Focused on *individuals* - who should have access, limiting access to authorized individuals
- **3.10.2**: Focused on *facilities and infrastructure* - where CUI p/s/t is physically protected and monitored, support infrastructure protected/monitored (Alabaster)

Badge systems can cover both: controls who has access (3.10.1) AND protects+monitors (3.10.2)
