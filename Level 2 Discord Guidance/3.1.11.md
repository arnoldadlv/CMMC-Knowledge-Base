# 3.1.11 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.1.11[a]: Conditions requiring a user session to terminate are defined.
- 3.1.11[b]: A user session is automatically terminated after any of the defined conditions occur.

---

## Sufficient

Based on actual assessor discussions and confirmed passing assessments:

1. **User-initiated logoff as a defined condition** - Confirmed as passing. Defining the condition as "when a user clicks log off, the session is terminated/logged off" has been accepted in L2 assessments. (Uncouth, CCP; John - passed assessment; Amira Armond video)

2. **Account disabled terminates session** - An Entra-oriented organization passed assessment with: "Sessions are terminated when user accounts are disabled." No timeout required. (John - passed assessment)

3. **Weekly forced reboot** - Configured as a weekly forced reboot which effectively terminates sessions and also helps with general client health/updates. (Uncouth, CCP)

4. **Scheduled daily logoff task** - A task to log off all user sessions once a day from all servers and laptops was discussed as potentially acceptable. (rafaAmd101 question, Spock67 response: "Define what needs to be terminated and when in ways that you can actually execute.")

5. **Microsoft GCC-High FedRAMP CRM approach** - M365 logs users out after receiving a logout request from the user. Additional controls exist for W365/Terminal Services. (John)

## Insufficient

No explicit examples of rejected evidence were discussed in this channel.

**Implicit risks based on discussion:**
- Relying solely on user behavior without any automatic enforcement mechanism
- Not having defined conditions documented anywhere

---

## Over-engineering

1. **2-hour idle logoff on standard workstations** - "Oh 2h unless it's a VDI you're gonna be annoying people." Short idle timeouts on non-VDI endpoints are unnecessary and disruptive. (Uncouth, CCP)

2. **Preparing for Rev 3 ODPs in current Rev 2 assessments** - CCAs are unlikely to assess against Rev 3 ODPs in L2 assessments under Rev 2. While planning ahead is wise, implementing the Rev 3 24-hour inactivity maximum is not currently required. (Glenda Snodgrass, Lead CCA: "I doubt you will find any CCAs using R3 ODPs to assess this control.")

## Edge Cases

### User Session vs. Network Session (3.1.11 vs. 3.13.9)
This was a major clarification topic:

- **3.1.11 = User/logical session** - "Terminate user-initiated logical sessions"
- **3.13.9 = Network connection** - "Termination of network connections associated with communications sessions"

Amira Armond (C3PAO): "Disagree, 3.13.9 is very different than this practice. Think Log off / disable account / reset password for this AC practice."

**Clarification on "logical session":**
- A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system
- An interactive session is one kind of logical session
- Background processes acting on user's behalf (like Outlook connecting to EXO without user action) are also user sessions
- "DoD appears to be using alternative terms to describe a user session" (rybo)

### VPN Client Timeout
VPN clients timing out every 12 hours relates to network disconnect (3.13.9), not user session termination (3.1.11). (rybo - clarification)

### Rev 3 Future Considerations
- Rev 3 ODPs explicitly define: "a specified duration (maximum of 24 hours) of inactivity"
- This may make inactivity-based logoff mandatory going forward
- Currently not required for Rev 2 assessments
- Recommended to consider Rev 3 when implementing to avoid future rework

### Endpoints vs. Cloud Services
Question raised: "What about the endpoints themselves, the laptops, assuming they are in scope, what control was used there for 3.1.11? Technically you need a control for all in-scope items." (jesse314_) - Left partially unanswered in thread.

---

## Evidence Examples

### Confirmed Passing Evidence (from actual assessments):

1. **SSP documentation stating:** "Sessions are terminated when user accounts are disabled." (Entra-oriented organization, no timeout - passed)

2. **FedRAMP CRM from GCC-High** - Shows how Microsoft met control: "M365 logs users out after receiving a logout request from the user"

### Discussed Implementation Tools:

1. **Lithnet Idle-Logoff** - GitHub tool for implementing idle logoff on Windows. "Solves the technical problems that I was running into with scheduled tasks and powershell scripts." (R2___)

### Policy Documentation:
- Define conditions in ways you can actually execute
- Organization-defined parameters (ODPs) for current Rev 2 can be flexible
- Rev 3 ODPs provide useful guidance even if not required

## Key Quotes

**On the distinction between 3.1.11 and 3.13.9:**
> "Disagree, 3.13.9 is very different than this practice. Think Log off / disable account / reset password for this AC practice." - Amira Armond (C3PAO)

**On defining conditions wisely:**
> "Another place to use the power of definition wisely. Define what needs to be terminated and when in ways that you can actually execute." - Spock67 (Certified CMMC Assessor)

**On what constitutes a logical session:**
> "A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system... An interactive session is simply one kind of logical session. My Outlook app establishes a user session with EXO without any action on my part (not interactive). It's a background process, but it's still a user session (Outlook acting on my behalf)." - rybo

**On current Rev 2 vs. Rev 3 expectations:**
> "I doubt you will find any CCAs using R3 ODPs to assess this control. Not saying that you would fail if you do. Choose wisely. Ask questions when interviewing C3PAOs." - Glenda Snodgrass (Lead CCA)

**On using Rev 3 ODPs proactively:**
> "I don't think it's counterproductive to use those ODPs wherever it's not a major burden. I want my 'are defined' choices to be as defensible as possible." - JB

**On practical timeout considerations:**
> "Oh 2h unless it's a VDI you're gonna be annoying people. I believe we have ours configured as a weekly forced reboot which effectively terminates sessions as well as helps with general client health/updates/etc." - Uncouth (CCP)

**From the L2 Assessment Guide (quoted in discussion):**
> "If there is no automatic control of user sessions, an attacker can take advantage of an unattended session"

**On confirmed passing implementation:**
> "In our SSP we put that sessions are terminated when user accounts are disabled, and passed an assessment with that. (Entra oriented organization). Nothing about timeouts after a certain amount of time." - John (Established Member)
