# 3.12.1 - Expertise Overlay

**Control:** Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.12.1[a] the frequency of security control assessments is defined.
- 3.12.1[b] security controls are assessed with the defined frequency to determine if the controls are effective in their application.

## Sufficient

- **Annual self-assessment** of NIST 800-171 controls meets the minimum frequency requirement (Assessment guide defines "periodic" as at least annually)
- **Risk-based tiered assessment frequencies** - Some organizations assess certain controls weekly, monthly, or quarterly based on risk, with annual as the baseline (Spock67, CCA)
- **Defined frequency documented in policy** - Must explicitly state how often assessments occur
- **Assessing control effectiveness**, not just compliance checking - Going beyond simple Met/Not Met to evaluate if controls are actually mitigating risk as intended

## Insufficient

- **Standard compliance self-assessment alone** - Simply reading the SSP and asking "Am I doing this?" is NOT sufficient. The control requires asking "Is this an effective way to be meeting the intent?" (Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA)
- **Relying on real-world events without structured review** - You cannot simply plan to "test the plan when we have an incident" - this does not meet the control (Example from Glenda R. Snodgrass)
- **No defined frequency** - Assessment frequency must be explicitly defined; cannot leave "periodic" undefined

## Edge Cases

### 3.12.1 vs 3.12.3 Distinction
- **3.12.1 (Periodic):** "Is the control, as-designed, mitigating the risk as you expect?" - Reviewed periodically (e.g., yearly)
- **3.12.3 (Continuous Monitoring):** "Monitor that the control continues to work as expected" - Ongoing monitoring
- **Key words:** "periodic vs ongoing" differentiates these two controls (Jake/ace_rimmer, Fellow)

### Using Real Incidents Instead of Exercises
- One assessor indicated failover events cannot substitute for continuity plan testing - requires actual test plan
- However, another CCA (Spock67) takes a more flexible approach: if a real incident occurs with proper lessons learned documentation similar to what would be expected from an exercise, this can be accepted
- **Key factor:** Must have a lessons learned process that produces similar outcomes to a formal exercise

### CMMC Rule Frequency Interpretation
- Initial interpretation: CMMC rule states L2/L3 self-assessments required triennially (every 3 years)
- **Correction:** The 3-year requirement applies only to contracts with L2 self-assessment requirements (not third-party assessments) - which will be "very few orgs"
- **Final guidance:** Assessment guide still defines periodic as "at least annually" - this is the operative standard for most organizations

## Evidence Examples

- Documented assessment frequency in policy
- Assessment records showing periodic reviews at defined intervals
- Evidence of evaluating control effectiveness (not just compliance status)
- Lessons learned documentation from either exercises or actual incidents
- Records showing risk-based assessment scheduling (weekly/monthly/quarterly for high-risk controls)

## Key Quotes

> "Annual self-assessment of your 171 implementation? No. This is an assessment of the way you have chosen to implement it. So a standard self assessment reads the SSP and asks 'Am I doing this?' For this control, look at the SSP and ask 'Is this an effective way to be meeting the intent?'"
> - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

> "The key words are periodic vs ongoing"
> - Jake/ace_rimmer (Fellow) - distinguishing 3.12.1 from 3.12.3

> "As with all things CMMC the min standard for periodically is annual. There are of course much more nuanced ways to do this. Some assess some controls weekly, some monthly, some quarterly based on the risk. Assessing effectiveness can go beyond simple Met/Not Met though"
> - Spock67, CCA

> "I had one client write in their SSP for IR 'We will test the plan when we have an incident.' And I'm like, 'Umm, no, that doesn't meet this control.'"
> - Glenda R. Snodgrass, Lead CCA

> "Assessment guide still defined periodic as at least annually, so it seems this requirement needs to be completed at least once per year."
> - Cuipacabra, CCP (correcting earlier interpretation about triennial assessments)
