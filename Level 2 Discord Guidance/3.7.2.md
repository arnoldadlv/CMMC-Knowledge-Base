# 3.7.2 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Provide controls on the tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel used to conduct system maintenance.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- 3.7.2[a] tools used to conduct system maintenance are controlled.
- 3.7.2[b] techniques used to conduct system maintenance are controlled.
- 3.7.2[c] mechanisms used to conduct system maintenance are controlled.
- 3.7.2[d] personnel used to conduct system maintenance are controlled.

## Sufficient

### MSP Tools Within Authorization Boundary
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow), citing DISA guidance for MA-3:
- "This requirement addresses security-related issues associated with maintenance tools that are not within system authorization boundaries"
- If an MSP is considered part of the authorization boundary, their tools would not be in scope for this specific control
- Native diagnostic tools (ping, ls, ipconfig) are addressed through other controls (AC-6(10), SC-2, CM-5)

### External MSP/RMM Tools
Per rybo (Moderator/Fellow):
- For external MSPs installing maintenance tools (RMM) on your systems, use 3.1.20 guidance
- "Terms and conditions address as a minimum: the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems"
- RMM tools accessed by MSPs are "applications accessed on organizational systems from external systems"

### Defining Techniques vs Mechanisms
Per scotty, CCP:
- **Techniques**: How you would do something - documentation, process documentation
- **Mechanisms**: Automated scripts, scheduled jobs, etc.

### Policy-Based Approach
- Add details to System Maintenance policy stating that only authorized mechanisms listed in Asset & User Management are allowed
- Document maintenance personnel authorized to use these mechanisms

## Edge Cases

### MSP Authorization Boundary Question
Question: "If a MSP is considered part of the authorization boundary then the tools that they use for maintenance would not be in scope?"

Response (rybo - Moderator/Fellow):
- DISA guidance clarifies this requirement focuses on "maintenance tools that are not within system authorization boundaries"
- Native system tools are handled by other controls
- External tools (RMM) should be addressed via 3.1.20 terms and conditions

---

## Evidence Examples

- System Maintenance policy documenting authorized tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel
- Asset & User Management list with authorized maintenance mechanisms
- Terms and conditions for external MSP/RMM tool access
- Documentation of authorized maintenance personnel
- Process documentation for maintenance techniques

## Key Quotes

> "This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of the system (e.g., the software implementing 'ping,' 'ls,' 'ipconfig,' or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch)."
> -- DISA guidance for MA-3, cited by rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "For external MSPs who wish to install maintenance tools (i.e., RMM) on your systems: 800-171 requirement 3.1.20 (verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems) gives us excellent guidance."
> -- rybo (Moderator/Fellow)

> "Techniques: How you would do something. Documentation, process documentation. Mechanisms: automated scripts, scheduled jobs, etc."
