# 3.5.9 - Expertise Overlay

**Control Text:** Allow temporary password use for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.

---

## Sufficient

- **Technical enforcement via AD/Entra ID:** When using Active Directory or Entra ID-based accounts, technical enforcement of immediate password change is expected because it is simple to implement
- **Policy-based approach when technical enforcement is not possible:** Written policy with instructions requiring users to change temporary passwords is acceptable when the system does not support forced password change (e.g., hybrid AD/Entra AVD environments where first sign-on prevents password change until inside the AVD)
- **Justification for procedural controls:** If you cannot technically enforce immediate password change, provide a clear explanation of WHY - assessors will accept reasonable justifications

## Insufficient

- **Relying on policy alone when technical enforcement is available:** Using only written instructions when AD or Entra ID technical enforcement is easily configurable would likely be questioned by assessors
- **No explanation for lack of technical controls:** Failing to justify why procedural controls are used instead of technical enforcement when the system supports it

## Over-engineering

No discussion found.

## Edge Cases

- **Hybrid AD/Entra AVD environments:** Technical enforcement may not be possible on first sign-on; users may need to access the AVD before they can change their password. Policy-based controls are acceptable in this scenario with proper documentation.
- **Local accounts on specific devices:** Some device-specific local accounts may not support forced password change functionality; written instructions can suffice for these cases

## Evidence Examples

- AD/Entra ID configuration showing "User must change password at next logon" setting enabled
- Written policy/procedure documenting temporary password handling when technical enforcement is not possible
- Documentation explaining why technical enforcement cannot be used in specific scenarios

## Key Quotes

> "I think i would only do that when the particular account doesn't support it. If it is an AD or entra ID based account then it's so easy to do theres no reason not to do it."
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "The trick for an assessor is answering the why you are not doing something so simple and easy and if there is a good justification then normal people will go oh OK that makes sense."
> -- Jeff Baldwin (Certified CMMC Assessor)

> "Policy should suffice if it can't be enforced - I've seen this with hybrid AD/Entra AVD where first sign on will not let the user change password they have to get into the AVD to change it"
> -- wogmail (Moderator/Fellow)

> "This falls under the above mentioned explain why you cant do it and then I go oh ok makes sense"
