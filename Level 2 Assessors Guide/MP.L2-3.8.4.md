## MP.L2-3.8.4 – MEDIA MARKINGS

### SECURITY REQUIREMENT

Mark media with necessary CUI markings and distribution limitations.

### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES

Determine if:

:   [a] media containing CUI is marked with applicable CUI markings; and
:   [b] media containing CUI is marked with distribution limitations.

### POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS

**Examine**

[SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing media marking; physical and environmental protection policy and procedures; system security plan; list of system media marking security attributes; designated controlled areas; other relevant documents or records].

**Interview**

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system media protection and marking responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities].

**Test**

[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for marking information media; mechanisms supporting or implementing media marking].

### DISCUSSION

The term security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security attributes. System media includes digital and non-digital media. Marking of system media reflects applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, and regulations.

### FURTHER DISCUSSION

All media, hardcopy and digital, must be properly marked to alert individuals to the presence of CUI stored on the media. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has published guidelines for labeling media of different sizes.

MP.L2-3.8.8 requires that media have an identifiable owner, so organizations may find it desirable to include ownership information on the device label as well.

**Example**

You were recently contacted by the project team for a new DoD program. The team said they wanted the CUI in use for the program to be properly protected. When speaking with them, you realize that most of the protections will be provided as part of existing enterprise cybersecurity capabilities. They also mentioned that the project team will use several USB drives to share specific data. You explain that the team must ensure the USB drives are externally marked to indicate the presence of CUI [a]. The project team labels the outside of each USB drive with an appropriate CUI label following NARA guidance [a]. Further, the labels indicate that distribution is limited to those employees supporting the DoD program [a].

**Potential Assessment Considerations**

* Are all media containing CUI identified [a,b]?
