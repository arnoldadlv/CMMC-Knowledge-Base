## PE.L2-3.10.1 – LIMIT PHYSICAL ACCESS

Level 1 Reference: PE.L1-b.1.viii

### SECURITY REQUIREMENT

Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.

### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES

Determine if:

:   [a] authorized individuals allowed physical access are identified;
:   [b] physical access to organizational systems is limited to authorized individuals;
:   [c] physical access to equipment is limited to authorized individuals; and
:   [d] physical access to operating environments is limited to authorized individuals.

### POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS

**Examine**

[SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy; procedures addressing physical access authorizations; system security plan; authorized personnel access list; authorization credentials; physical access list reviews; physical access termination records and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].

**Interview**

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with physical access authorization responsibilities; personnel with physical access to system facility; personnel with information security responsibilities].

**Test**

[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access authorizations; mechanisms supporting or implementing physical access authorizations].

### DISCUSSION

This requirement applies to employees, individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials, and visitors. Authorized individuals have credentials that include badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, procedures, and guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible.

Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing equipment in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing devices, external disk drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of equipment.

### FURTHER DISCUSSION

This addresses the company’s physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment rooms), technical assets, and non-technical assets that need to be protected from unauthorized physical access. Specific environments are limited to authorized employees, and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc.

Output devices, such as printers, are placed in areas where their use does not expose data to unauthorized individuals. Lists of personnel with authorized access are developed and maintained, and personnel are issued appropriate authorization credentials.

**Example**

You manage a DoD project that requires special equipment used only by project team members [b,c]. You work with the facilities manager to put locks on the doors to the areas where the equipment is stored and used [b,c,d].Project team members are the only individuals issued with keys to the space. This restricts access to only those employees who work on the DoD project and require access to that equipment.

**Potential Assessment Considerations**

* Are lists of personnel with authorized access developed and maintained, and are appropriate authorization credentials issued [a]?
* Has the facility/building manager designated building areas as “sensitive” and designed physical security protections (e.g., guards, locks, cameras, card readers) to limit physical access to the area to only authorized employees [b,c,d]?
* Are output devices such as printers placed in areas where their use does not expose data to unauthorized individuals [c]?
