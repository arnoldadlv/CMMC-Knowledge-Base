## PS.L2-3.9.1 – SCREEN INDIVIDUALS

### SECURITY REQUIREMENT

Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI.

### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES

Determine if:

:   [a] individuals are screened prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI.

### POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS

**Examine**

[SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing personnel screening; records of screened personnel; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].

**Interview**

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with personnel security responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities].

**Test**

[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel screening].

### DISCUSSION

Personnel security screening (vetting) activities involve the evaluation/assessment of individual’s conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability (i.e., the trustworthiness of the individual) prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI. The screening activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and specific criteria established for the level of access required for assigned positions.

### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Ensure all employees who need access to CUI undergo organization-defined screening before being granted access. Base the types of screening on the requirements for a given position and role.

The effective screening of personnel provided by this practice, PS.L2-3.9.1, improves upon the effectiveness of authentication performed in IA.L1-3.5.2.

**Example**

You are in charge of security at your organization. You complete standard criminal background and credit checks of all individuals you hire before they can access CUI [a]. Your screening program follows appropriate laws, policies, regulations, and criteria for the level of access required for each position.

**Potential Assessment Considerations**

* Are appropriate background checks completed prior granting access to organizational systems containing CUI [a]?
