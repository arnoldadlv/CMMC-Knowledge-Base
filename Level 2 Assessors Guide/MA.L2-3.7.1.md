## MA.L2-3.7.1 – PERFORM MAINTENANCE

### SECURITY REQUIREMENT

Perform maintenance on organizational systems.

### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES

Determine if:

:   [a] system maintenance is performed.

### POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS

**Examine**

[SELECT FROM: System maintenance policy; procedures addressing controlled system maintenance; maintenance records; manufacturer or vendor maintenance specifications; equipment sanitization records; media sanitization records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].

**Interview**

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system maintenance responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities; personnel responsible for media sanitization; system or network administrators].

**Test**

[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for scheduling, performing, documenting, reviewing, approving, and monitoring maintenance and repairs for systems; organizational processes for sanitizing system components; mechanisms supporting or implementing controlled maintenance; mechanisms implementing sanitization of system components].

### DISCUSSION

This requirement addresses the information security aspects of the system maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including hardware, firmware, applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal entity. System maintenance also includes those components not directly associated with information processing and data or information retention such as scanners, copiers, and printers.

### FURTHER DISCUSSION

One common form of computer security maintenance is regular patching of discovered vulnerabilities in software and operating systems, though there are others that require attention.

System maintenance includes:

* corrective maintenance (e.g., repairing problems with the technology);
* preventative maintenance (e.g., updates to prevent potential problems);
* adaptive maintenance (e.g., changes to the operative environment); and
* perfective maintenance (e.g., improve operations).

**Example**

You are responsible for maintenance activities on your company’s machines. This includes regular planned maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, reconfigurations when required, and damage repairs [a]. You know that failing to conduct maintenance activities can impact system security and availability, so you ensure that maintenance is regularly performed. You track all maintenance performed to assist with troubleshooting later if needed.

**Potential Assessment Considerations**

* Are systems, devices, and supporting systems maintained per manufacturer recommendations or company defined schedules [a]?
