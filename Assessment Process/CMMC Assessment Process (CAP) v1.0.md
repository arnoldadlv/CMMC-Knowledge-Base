# CMMC Assessment Process (CAP) v1.0

The *CMMC Assessment Process* (CAP) **is the CMMC doctrine providing the overarching procedures and guidance** for CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs) conducting official CMMC Assessments of organizations seeking CMMC Certification.

This version of the CAP applies to **Level Two (L2)** of the CMMC Model only.

The CAP is organized across **four (4) phases**:

1. **Phase 1** - "Plan and Prepare the Assessment"
2. **Phase 2** - "Conduct the Assessment"
3. **Phase 3** - "Report Assessment Results"
4. **Phase 4** - "Close-Out POA&Ms and Assessment" *(if necessary)*

These phases ensure every CMMC Assessment meets the following objectives:

- Achieve the highest possible accuracy, fidelity, and quality for CMMC Assessments conducted by C3PAOs
- Maximize consistency to ensure different Assessments by different C3PAOs and Assessors yield the same verifiable results
- Improve the cybersecurity defensive posture and the cyber resiliency of the DIB

The CAP is designed to be used alongside the *CMMC Model Overview*, *CMMC Assessment Guide - Level 2*, [[CMMC Scoping Guide - Level 2]], the *CMMC eMASS Concept of Operations for C3PAOs*, and the *CMMC Artifact Hashing Tool User Guide*.

---

## Phase 1 - Plan and Prepare the Assessment

A strong and effective CMMC Certification Assessment begins with a well-organized planning and preparation effort. The critical foundation for a successful Assessment engagement between C3PAOs and OSCs is established in Phase 1.

Phase 1 Assessment planning could range from one (1) to several days, depending on C3PAO-OSC communication effectiveness and the OSC's readiness and ability to provide the required information.

### 1.1 Receive CMMC Assessment Request from OSC

An OSC generally initiates the engagement by contacting an authorized C3PAO. The updated registry of authorized C3PAOs in good standing is maintained in the CMMC Marketplace administered by The Cyber AB.

Once the request is received, the C3PAO should respond to the OSC within **five (5) business days**, acknowledging the request and proposing an initial coordination call or virtual meeting. During this initial exchange, the C3PAO should confirm the requested timeframes and geographic location(s) for the Assessment.

> [!note]
> The OSC's initial request may include the identification or preference for a specific Lead Assessor or CMMC Assessment Team Member, but the authority and decision for selecting and assigning the CMMC Assessment Team rests solely with the C3PAO.

### 1.2 Establish Roles and Responsibilities

A consistent, accurate, fair, and efficient CMMC Assessment requires the active engagement of several key figures and entities:

- **Organization Seeking Certification (OSC):** The DIB company, organization, university or college, legal entity, or discrete business division or practice area that is pursuing CMMC Certification by contracting with a C3PAO and proceeding with a CMMC Assessment.
- **OSC Assessment Official:** The most senior representative of an OSC who is directly and actively responsible for leading and managing the OSC's engagement in the Assessment and who possesses decision-making authority for the OSC. Must be an employee of the organization being assessed.
- **OSC Point of Contact (OSC POC):** The individual within the OSC who provides daily coordination and liaison support between the OSC and the Assessment Team. Does not necessarily have to be an employee of the organization being assessed.
- **CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO):** An authorized and independent conformity-Assessment body that contracts with the OSC to conduct CMMC Assessments and issues the CMMC Certification. Authorized C3PAOs are listed on the CMMC Marketplace.
- **C3PAO Assessment Team:** The representative body of a C3PAO composed of certified personnel who conduct a CMMC Assessment and any additional, non-certified individuals who may provide administrative or logistical support.
- **Lead Assessor:** The CMMC Certified Assessor (CCA) who oversees and manages a dedicated CMMC Assessment Team for the Assessment of an OSC. Lead Assessors hold the formal designation as such from the CMMC Accreditation Body.
- **Assessment Team Members:** Individuals who comprise the C3PAO Assessment Team.
- **CMMC Quality Assurance Professional (CQAP):** The formally trained individual responsible for ensuring Assessment documentation completeness and accuracy. Each C3PAO is required to have at least one (1) CQAP on staff.

### 1.3 Discuss Contractual Arrangements

OSCs retain the services of an authorized C3PAO to conduct a CMMC Assessment. The privity of contract exists between the OSC and the C3PAO; neither The Cyber AB nor the Department of Defense are parties to this agreement.

> [!warning] Prohibited
> All contractual agreements must comport to the CMMC Code of Professional Conduct. Certification "guarantees" are prohibited.

The C3PAO works with the OSC Assessment Official to determine an anticipated level-of-effort and associated cost estimate. Prior to beginning Assessment, the contractual agreement shall be signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

### 1.4 Organize and Prepare Assessment Documents and Templates

The C3PAO Assessment Team shall maintain regular familiarity and currency with the full body of CMMC Assessment doctrine. In addition to the CAP, the compendium of CMMC doctrine includes:

- *Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Model Overview*, Version 2.0
- *CMMC Assessment Guide*, Level 2, Version 2.0
- *CMMC Assessment Scope*, Level 2, Version 2.0
- *CMMC eMASS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for CMMC Third Party Assessment Organizations*
- *CMMC Artifact Hashing Tool User Guide*, Version 2.0

### 1.5 Ascertain Assessment Conditions and Requirements

Upon agreement between the parties to proceed, the C3PAO works with the OSC Assessment Official and OSC POC to determine the purview and planning details of the Assessment.

> [!important] Assessment Framing vs. CMMC Assessment Scope
> It is critical to distinguish between two types of "scoping":
> 1. **Assessment framing** - the high-level *contract* scoping discussed and agreed to at the onset of the C3PAO-OSC engagement
> 2. **CMMC Assessment Scope** - an official and technical CMMC term defining the boundaries within an organization's networked environment that contain all the assets that will be assessed
>
> See [[CMMC Scoping Guide - Level 2]] for detailed guidance on determining proper CMMC Assessment Scope.

#### 1.5.1 Frame the Assessment

The C3PAO works with the OSC to frame the Assessment. Follow-on substantive conversations should be between the C3PAO and the OSC Assessment Official.

> [!tip]
> It is recommended that the C3PAO and OSC sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) as part of the initial contractual arrangement.

For Assessment framing, the C3PAO and OSC shall discuss and agree upon:

- Assessment location(s), including what will be conducted virtually
- Identification of OSC staff that will provide Evidence and support
- OSC's CMMC Assessment Scope
- OSC's relevant documentation, including roles and responsibilities of IT and security staff
- Evidence
- A rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimate for duration and timing
- Assessment outputs provided to the OSC Assessment Official upon completion

#### 1.5.2 Identify Lead Assessor

The C3PAO reviews the CMMC Pre-Assessment Data Form and considers prospective CCAs to assign as Lead Assessor. Considerations include the size and complexity of the Assessment, geographical location, familiarity with the OSC's lines of business, and any potential conflicts of interest.

#### 1.5.3 Confirm the Corporate Identity to be Assessed

The Lead Assessor works with the OSC Assessment Official and/or OSC POC to confirm the specific corporate legal entity that will be assessed. Key definitions:

- **HQ Organization:** The legal entity delivering services or products under the terms of a DoD contract. Could be the OSC itself, or it could designate a Host Unit.
- **Host Unit:** The specific people, procedures, and technology within an HQ Organization applied to the DoD contract and considered the OSC for CMMC Assessment purposes.
  - **Enclave:** A set of system resources operating within the same security domain and continuous security perimeter, intended to "wall off" that network or database from all other networks or systems.
- **Supporting Organizations:** People, procedures, and technology external to the HQ Organization that support the Host Unit. Assets affiliated with Supporting Organizations may need to be included in the CMMC Assessment Scope, but Supporting Organizations themselves would NOT receive a CMMC Certification.

> [!info] Required Identifiers
> The HQ Organization or Host Unit must possess a valid **Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code** and have registered with **SAM.gov** with a **Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)**. The Assessment cannot proceed without a valid CAGE code.

#### 1.5.4 Validate CMMC Assessment Scope

Determining the proper and accurate CMMC Assessment Scope is essential. The OSC has the initial responsibility to establish the CMMC Assessment Scope of their networked environment. For guidance, refer to [[CMMC Scoping Guide - Level 2]].

The OSC presents the CMMC Assessment Scope to the Lead Assessor, who then verifies its accuracy and integrity. The OSC must also provide supporting documentation such as network schematic diagrams, the System Security Plan (SSP), policies, and organizational charts.

The Lead Assessor is required to validate the OSC's CMMC Assessment Scope. Any disagreements or differences of opinion must be resolved before the actual Assessment may commence.

##### 1.5.4.1 Ascertain the Use of External Cloud Service Providers

During scope validation, the C3PAO may encounter the OSC's relationship to Supporting Organizations providing "external cloud services" through an external connection under CMMC practice AC.L1-3.1.20.

For CMMC purposes, these Supporting Organizations providing "cloud computing" services to OSCs are considered **External Cloud Service Providers**, the term used in DFARS 252.204-7012(b)(2)(ii)(D).

> [!warning] Critical Requirement
> If the External Cloud Service Provider processes, transmits, or stores CUI, **the External Cloud Service Provider is subject to the requirements of DFARS 252.204-7012(b)(2)(ii)(D)** and applicable DoD policies related to the requirements, including meeting security requirements equivalent to FedRAMP Moderate baseline.

> [!note]
> **The vast majority of OSCs will likely NOT be operating IT services or systems on behalf of the Government.** For these OSCs, the cloud security requirements established in DFARS 252.204-7012(b)(2)(ii)(D) are controlling for CMMC Assessments.

Key determinations for External Cloud Service Providers with external connections:

- Whether the external connection is functioning for delivery of products and services through cloud services
- The flow of CUI (and FCI), or the restriction thereof, between the OSC and the External Cloud Service Provider
- Any Specified CUI requirements impacting either the OSC or their External Cloud Service Provider

External Cloud Service Providers that do **not** store, process, or transmit CUI but contribute to the OSC's environment containing CUI and FCI (providing protection) **must only meet NIST SP 800-171 requirements and attain CMMC certification for CUI/FCI** (or only meet CMMC Level 1 requirements when only FCI is present).

#### 1.5.5 Evaluate Model Non-Duplication

Some OSCs may possess alternative cybersecurity certifications (ISO 27001, FedRAMP, etc.). Absent subsequent official non-duplication policies published by DoD, other cybersecurity conformance regimes do not bestow any status or credit toward an OSC's CMMC Assessment or Certification.

#### 1.5.6 Inventory OSC Cybersecurity Practices Against CMMC Model

The OSC shall provide to the C3PAO Assessment Team:

- Results of most recent OSC self-Assessment or any pre-Assessment conducted by an RP or RPO
- A preliminary list of anticipated Evidence
- The System Security Plan and other relevant documentation
- A list of all OSC personnel who play a role in the procedures that are in scope

The Assessment Team then collaborates with the OSC to correlate all information to each of the CMMC practices ("triage" / "cross-walk") to establish mutual understanding that all practices have been addressed with some evidentiary basis.

#### 1.5.7 Verify and Record Evidence Against Adequacy and Sufficiency Criteria

The Lead Assessor determines and confirms the estimate of needed interviews, observations, reviews, and related Evidence for each practice or process:

- **Adequacy:** criteria to determine if a given artifact, interview response, demo, or test demonstrates performance of a CMMC practice. Answers: "Does the Assessment Team have the right Evidence?"
- **Sufficiency:** criteria to verify, based on CMMC Assessment Scope, that domain and practice coverage is enough (sufficient) to rate against each practice. Answers: "Does the Assessment Team have enough of the right Evidence?"

All Evidence must:
- Cover the sampled Host Units and/or Supporting Organizations
- Cover the model scope of the Assessment ([[CMMC Scoping Guide - Level 2]])
- Correspond to the Host Unit and/or Supporting Organizations in the Evidence collection approach

#### 1.5.8 Review OSC Self-Assessment and DoD Assessment Findings Criteria

The Lead Assessor and the OSC POC shall jointly review the OSC's most recent CMMC self-assessment against DoD's criteria for assessment of CMMC practices. Assessment findings result in one of three possible outcomes:

- **MET:** The contractor successfully meets the practice. The Certified Assessor includes statements indicating the response conforms to all objectives and documents the appropriate evidence.
- **NOT MET:** The contractor has not met the practice. The Certified Assessor includes statements explaining why and documents appropriate evidence that the contractor does not conform fully to all objectives.
- **NOT APPLICABLE (N/A):** The practice does not apply. The Certified Assessor includes a statement explaining why the practice does not apply to the contractor.

> [!info] Inheritance
> A contractor can inherit practice objectives. A practice objective that is inherited is MET if adequate evidence is provided that the enterprise or another entity, such as an External Service Provider (ESP), performs the practice objective. If the contractor cannot demonstrate adequate evidence for all assessment objectives through either contractor evidence or evidence of inheritance, the OSC will receive a NOT MET for the practice.

### 1.6 Complete Pre-Assessment Planning

The Pre-Assessment Data Form is the holistic planning document for the Assessment itself. It must be maintained up-to-date throughout Phase 1 and updated whenever any significant change occurs.

> [!important]
> Any official CMMC Certification Assessment must have a documented and current Assessment Plan, using the required CMMC Assessment Plan template, or a C3PAO equivalent document with the same data.

#### 1.6.1 Develop Evidence Collection Approach

The Lead Assessor shall identify methods, techniques, and responsibilities for collecting, managing, and reviewing Evidence, including:

- Artifact gathering and availability
- Interview approach
- Test or demonstration observation approach
- Requests for information (email or surveys)

> [!warning] 15 Mandatory On-Site Practice Objectives
> Implementation validation of the following **15 CMMC practice objectives must be observed by the C3PAO Assessment Team in-person and on the premises of the OSC**:
>
> - CM.L2-3.4.5\[d\], MA.L2-3.7.2\[d\], MP.L2-3.8.1\[c\], MP.L2-3.8.1\[d\], MP.L2-3.8.4\[a\], MP.L2-3.8.4\[b\], PE.L1-3.10.1\[b\], PE.L1-3.10.1\[c\], PE.L2-3.10.2\[a\], PE.L2-3.10.2\[d\], PE.L1-3.10.3\[a\], PE.L1-3.10.3\[b\], PE.L1-3.10.5\[b\], PE.L1-3.10.5\[c\], SC.L2-3.13.12\[b\]
>
> These may be exempted from mandatory on-site assessment if the OSC employs a cloud services provider to manage them and the CSP holds FedRAMP Moderate certification or a valid determination of its equivalency.

#### 1.6.2 Select Assessment Team Members

The identification and assignment of C3PAO Assessment Team Members should be conducted with deliberate consideration. Factors include:

- Absence of any conflicts of interest with the OSC
- Availability for the targeted date range
- Cost, especially for independent (1099) Assessors
- Years of experience
- Geographic location
- Specialization with a particular DIB sub-sector
- Professional reputation within the CMMC Ecosystem

#### 1.6.3 Identify Resources and Schedule

Through iterative dialogue, the Lead Assessor and the OSC Assessment Official determine the resources and schedule. The C3PAO has the primary responsibility for verifying that all planning requirements have been met.

#### 1.6.4 Identify and Manage Conflicts of Interest (COI)

A basic conflict of interest is a situation where an individual or organization involved in multiple interests could simultaneously serve as working against the best interests of another. COIs must be avoided or mitigated within the CMMC Ecosystem.

> [!danger] Mandatory
> All parties should be familiar with--and refer to regularly--the conflict-of-interest provisions and prohibitions within the CMMC Code of Professional Conduct. Prior to commencing the Assessment, the Lead Assessor and all Assessment Team Members must attest (by signature) and submit the "Absence of Conflict-of-Interest Confirmation Statement."

### 1.7 Verify Readiness to Conduct the Assessment

The final step of Phase 1 is to confirm that all parties are ready and positioned to conduct the CMMC Assessment. The Lead Assessor shall arrive at one of four possible determinations:

1. **Proceed with the Assessment as planned:** all preparedness requirements have been met
2. **Replan the Assessment:** not all preparedness requirements have been met, requiring resolution
3. **Reschedule:** all requirements met but planning conditions compromised due to external factors
4. **Cancel the Assessment:** insurmountable factors such as a COI that cannot be mitigated

> [!warning] Prohibited
> The CMMC Accreditation Body **does not permit** a C3PAO to perform a readiness review with the intent of identifying weakness in Evidence so the OSC can take corrective action prior to Phase 2. At no time shall the Assessment Team provide any advice or recommendation on how the OSC could improve or enhance the sufficiency or adequacy of their presented Evidence.

> [!danger] Prohibited
> **Under no circumstances shall the C3PAO offer any advice, implementation assistance, or recommendations as to how the OSC can improve or enhance their preparedness for a replanned or rescheduled CMMC Assessment.** Doing so is an explicit violation of the CMMC Code of Professional Conduct.

#### 1.7.1 Access and Verify Evidence

The Lead Assessor and/or Assessment Team Members shall perform a cursory review of the actual Evidence to verify that it exists and is ready for formal scrutiny in Phase 2. Evidence is only being *verified* at this stage; it is *not being examined*.

#### 1.7.2 Make Assessment Feasibility Determination

Based on the verified existence of Evidence, resource estimates, objectives, plans, and schedule, the Lead Assessor shall determine if conducting the Assessment is feasible and documents the recommendation in writing. The C3PAO retains the ultimate decision authority.

#### 1.7.3 Conduct Quality Review on Pre-Assessment Form Data

C3PAOs shall have at least one CMMC Quality Assurance Professional (CQAP) supporting its Assessment Teams. The CQAP verifies the Pre-Assessment Form data prior to uploading into CMMC eMASS to ensure accuracy and completeness, including that information is properly structured in JSON format.

#### 1.7.4 Upload Pre-Assessment Form into CMMC eMASS

Upon completion of the quality assurance review, the Lead Assessor shall direct one of the C3PAO's approved CMMC eMASS account holders to upload the Pre-Assessment Form into CMMC eMASS.

#### 1.7.5 Prepare the Assessment Team

Prior to commencing Phase 2, the Lead Assessor shall verify that all Assessment Team Members are sufficiently prepared, familiar with the CMMC Assessment Scope and SSP, and have been assigned specific roles and responsibilities.

---

## Phase 2 - Conduct the Assessment

The purpose of Phase 2 is to assess the implementation of CMMC practices by the OSC in conformance with the CMMC Model. The C3PAO Assessment Team will verify the adequacy and sufficiency of Evidence to determine whether the practices have met the required standard.

Most of the activities throughout this entire Phase are iterative in nature during an Assessment.

### 2.1 Convene Assessment Kickoff Meeting

The Lead Assessor will convene an Assessment kickoff meeting prior to the commencement of Assessment conduct. This meeting may be conducted in-person, virtually, or in a hybrid manner.

Attendees shall include the OSC Assessment Official, the OSC POC, the Assessment Team Members, and members of the OSC who will be participating. Any questions, issues, or concerns by either party should be identified, discussed, and resolved.

### 2.2 Collect and Examine Evidence

The CMMC Assessment Guide incorporates the Assessment procedures described in NIST SP 800-171A. Assessment methods include **examine**, **interview**, and **test**:

- **Examine method:** The process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing Assessment objects (specifications, mechanisms, activities). Must link directly to Assessment objectives and support determination of security safeguard existence, functionality, correctness, completeness, and potential for improvement over time.
- **Interview method:** The process of holding discussions with individuals or groups to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain Evidence. Must link directly to Assessment objectives. Interview affirmations must be provided by people who implement, perform, or support the practices.
- **Test method:** The process of exercising Assessment objects under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior. Any failed test results in a "NOT MET" for that CMMC practice.

#### 2.2.1 Examine and Analyze Evidence

For each relevant practice in the CMMC Model, the C3PAO Assessment Team will review and collect the Evidence to demonstrate that the practice is effectively implemented and conforms to the CMMC standard. Key principles:

- Evidence artifacts might not have a one-to-one relationship with CMMC practices
- Evidence should be evaluated based on the Assessment objectives defined in the CMMC Level 2 Assessment Guide
- The artifact being examined must be current and produced by the same individuals performing, implementing, or supporting the work
- Assessment artifacts that represent policies and procedures must demonstrate deployment and adoption by affected OSC personnel

#### 2.2.2 Conduct Interviews and Assess Responses

The Lead Assessor works with the OSC POC to identify staff within the OSC or third parties who perform procedures or have a role in supporting relevant cybersecurity activities. During interview sessions, the Assessment Team:

- Ensures confidentiality and non-attribution for interviewees
- Asks questions to get clarity and understanding of practice or process implementation
- Maps responses to CMMC model practices to aid in determining the rating of that practice

#### 2.2.3 Observe Tests and Analyze Results

Observing live tests or demonstrations provides detailed operational insight into the effectiveness of the CMMC practices. Any successful demonstration is noted as "MET." Any failed demonstration results in "NOT MET" for that CMMC practice.

#### 2.2.4 Determine FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency for Cloud Computing Providers

If the OSC is utilizing a Supporting Organization that is an External Cloud Service Provider, the C3PAO Assessment Team will ascertain and determine if the provider meets security requirements "equivalent" to FedRAMP Moderate baseline. The C3PAO shall examine two criteria:

1. The OSC or External Cloud Service Provider has provided a body of evidence documenting how security controls are equivalent to FedRAMP Moderate baseline standard
2. Said body of evidence has been attested to by an independent, credible, professional source

> [!note]
> A CMMC RP or RPO employed, contracted, or under a paid engagement with the OSC **may not** serve as the independent, credible, professional source for attesting to the FedRAMP Moderate body of evidence. A FedRAMP Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), however, retained by the OSC, **may serve** in this role.

#### 2.2.5 Identify and Document Evidence Gaps

The primary intent is to derive whether an Evidence gap exists between what the OSC's Evidence shows and what the C3PAO Assessment Team requires. Both **adequacy** and **sufficiency** are verified. Examples of Evidence deficiencies:

- Documents that are incomplete (e.g., authorized access control list missing new personnel)
- Affirmations that are illegitimate (e.g., attestation from an employee who is not the proper owner/operator/supervisor)
- Policies that lack endorsement by senior management

#### 2.2.6 Update Evidence Review Approach and Status

The Evidence collection and review approach provides a means to continuously monitor progress. Status is recorded on a minimum daily basis throughout the Assessment. If significant changes are incurred, those changes should be reflected in the Pre-Assessment Data Form and updated file exported to CMMC eMASS.

### 2.3 Score OSC Practices and Validate Preliminary Results

The Assessment Team shall score each in-scope CMMC practice based on the examination of Evidence. CMMC Assessments will be scored at the **objective level** using the "CMMC Scoring with DoD Assessment Scoring Methodology." Each practice with an objective(s) scored as NOT MET will inherently be scored as "NOT MET" for the entire practice.

#### 2.3.1 Determine and Record Initial Scores

The Assessment Team records initial MET/NOT MET/NA scores and prepares to review them during the daily checkpoint. Preliminary Findings must be presented to the OSC prior to the Final Findings presentation.

#### 2.3.2 Correct Limited Practice Deficiencies

A **Limited Practice Deficiency Correction** accommodation exists for OSCs where practices have been effectively implemented but not necessarily documented correctly. This provision is restricted to specific eligible practices that have a limited or indirect effect on security.

##### Ineligible Practices for Deficiency Corrections

- Practices that could lead to significant exploitation of the network or exfiltration of CUI
- Practices listed on the OSC's Self-Assessment Practice Deficiency Tracker
- Practices that were not implemented prior to the current CMMC Assessment
- Any practice that changes and/or limits the effectiveness of another "MET" practice

##### Eligible Practices for Limited Deficiency Correction

Both criteria must be met:
1. A practice that was implemented but missing minor updates, **where** practice Evidence demonstrates the implementation has been in place for a period of time
2. Consensus among the C3PAO Assessment Team that the practice does not change and/or limit the effectiveness of another "MET" practice

### 2.4 Generate and Validate Preliminary Recommended Findings

Based on examination of Evidence, the C3PAO Assessment Team shall generate and validate preliminary recommended findings summarizing all practice MET/NOT MET scores.

#### 2.4.1 Determine Final Practice MET/NOT MET/NA Results

After all Evidence has been reviewed, verified, rated, and discussed during the daily checkpoints, the Lead Assessor records the final recommended MET/NOT MET/NA score. The C3PAO holds the final interpretation authority.

> [!important] Scoring Thresholds
> - **Less than 80%** (88/110 practices "MET"): The OSC receives a final finding of **"Not Achieved"** for CMMC Level 2 Certification and must reapply.
> - **Greater than or equal to 80%** (88/110 practices "MET"): The OSC will be required to correct deficiencies within **five (5) business days** from the Final Findings Briefing.

##### POA&M Review

CMMC allows conditional use of Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to remediate practices that are not fully or successfully implemented. POA&Ms will be strictly time-bound with a validity period of **no more than 180 days** from the Final Recommended Findings Briefing (Phase 3).

POA&Ms will **not** be allowed for the highest-weighted CMMC requirements. The criteria for an OSC to receive a CMMC Level 2 Conditional Certification:

- 80% of all CMMC Level L2 practices scored "MET" (88/110 must be "MET")
- All POA&M items must meet the criteria in Appendix K, "CMMC Scoring with DoD Assessment Scoring Methodology"

#### 2.4.2 Create and Finalize and Record Recommended Final Findings

The CMMC Assessment Findings Brief must be updated to its final recommended state, including MET/NOT MET scores at the OSC aggregated level and describing any practice that has not been implemented in enough detail to show how the score was derived.

#### 2.4.3 Support Assessment Appeals Process

If the OSC feels there is an issue with scoring on a practice and there is substantial evidence showing ALL the objectives of the practice have been "MET," the OSC can submit a dispute using the Assessment Appeals Process outlined in Appendix Q.

---

## Phase 3 - Report Recommended Assessment Results

The formal submission of the final Assessment results codifies the adjudication of the CMMC Assessment. The Lead Assessor shall deliver the recommended Assessment results to the OSC during the Final Findings Briefing. Following that, the CQAP, Lead Assessor, and C3PAO will verify completeness and accuracy prior to upload into CMMC eMASS.

### 3.1 Deliver Recommended Assessment Results

The Lead Assessor shall provide the OSC Assessment Official and OSC participants with the Assessment results using the CMMC Final Findings Briefing along with the Pre-Assessment Form data.

#### 3.1.1 Deliver Final Findings

The Lead Assessor presents the final recommended findings using the Assessment Findings Brief Template: a summary of the recorded MET/NOT MET status of each practice within the CMMC Assessment Scope. Results are submitted to the C3PAO for review, and once the CQAP completes quality review, the designated C3PAO CMMC eMASS account holder submits the results.

### 3.2 Submit, Package, and Archive Assessment Documentation

The purpose is to package, baseline, and retain all Assessment documentation and artifacts.

| Required Output | Details |
|:---|:---|
| Recorded and Presented Final Recommended Findings | Completed by Lead Assessor using CMMC Findings Briefing template or equivalent |
| Submitted and archived Assessment Results Package into CMMC eMASS | Final Report, CMMC Assessment Results |
| OSC Artifacts Hash | Using the CMMC Artifact Hashing Tool User Guide |
| Recorded and final updated Daily Checkpoint | Must include results from all discussed practices including resulting actions and due dates |

#### 3.2.1 Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Evaluation

The C3PAO Assessment Team will review Evidence provided by the OSC to close out items on the Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Program. If all items are corrected and "fully implemented," the score changes to "MET." If evidence still shows deficiencies, the score remains "NOT MET."

> [!important] 80% Threshold for POA&M
> **The current score of the Assessment, after executing a POA&M review, must be greater than or equal to 80% (88/110 practices "MET"), to move the OSC to the POA&M Close-Out Assessment option.** In this course of action, the OSC will remain on their Conditional CMMC Level 2 Certification, with their original start date.

#### 3.2.2 Verify Assessment Results Package

The CQAP shall verify Assessment documentation prior to eMASS upload. The Final Report must be submitted to the CQAP for review no later than **ten (10) business days** from the Final Findings Briefing.

#### 3.2.3 Upload Assessment Results Package into CMMC eMASS

All Assessment results are uploaded into CMMC eMASS for official recording and tracking. The Assessment results package must include:

- **Final Report:** The detailed practices and scores, clearly traceable to each finding and score, using the CMMC Assessment Results Template
- **Reports must be uploaded to eMASS no later than twenty (20) Business Days from the Final Findings Briefing**

#### 3.2.4 Archive or Dispose of any Assessment Artifacts

The Lead Assessor is responsible for maintaining and protecting any additional notes and information from the Assessment. These must be retained and protected from a confidentiality, non-disclosure, and any other CUI perspective for **three (3) years**.

> [!danger] Mandatory Artifact Retention
> The Confirmation of Destruction of OSC Data template can be used to verify disposal of Assessment artifacts from all Assessment Team Members. Each Assessor's signed document shall be retained by the C3PAO for **three (3) years**.

#### 3.2.5 Adjudicate Any Assessment Appeals

If the OSC believes their Assessment was compromised by technical error or a breach of ethical conduct, the OSC can submit an official appeal using the Assessment Appeals Process outlined in Appendix Q.

#### 3.2.6 Schedule a CMMC POA&M Close-Out Assessment *(if necessary)*

The OSC is responsible for ensuring all practice deficiencies on the validated POA&M are corrected within the **180-day timeframe** from the CMMC Final Findings Briefing. This includes scheduling a CMMC POA&M Close-Out Assessment as described in Phase 4.

> [!note]
> While the same Lead Assessor and/or C3PAO issuing the Conditional CMMC Certification **IS NOT** responsible for conducting the follow-up POA&M Close-Out Assessment, a Lead Assessor representing an Authorized C3PAO is still required to conduct the activities in Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4 - Close-Out POA&Ms and Assessment *(if necessary)*

The purpose of Phase 4 is to allow OSCs that received a Conditional CMMC Level 2 Certification during Phase 3 to close out all practices validated on Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&M) during the C3PAO Assessment. The final OSC POA&M must be validated in Phase 2 by the Lead Assessor and C3PAO prior to upload of the Assessment results into CMMC eMASS in Phase 3.

### 4.1 Perform POA&M Close-Out Assessment

Within **180 days** from the Assessment Final Recommended Findings Briefing, the OSC will select a C3PAO to conduct a POA&M Close-Out Assessment. The Lead Assessor will review the OSC's updated POA&M with any accompanied Evidence or scheduled collections. All POA&M items must be validated against:

- The specific security weakness revealed by POA&M has been "fully-implemented" and scored as "MET"
- All POA&M items "fully-implemented" do not change and/or limit the effectiveness of another "MET" practice
- An updated risk assessment documents the removal of the previous CMMC practices listed on the POA&M
- An updated POA&M reflects no CMMC practice deficiencies

#### 4.1.1 Update POA&M Closeout

If all practices on the POA&M Review result in a score of "MET," the Lead Assessor will close out the Assessment using the steps in Phase 3 and recommend the OSC be granted a **CMMC Level 2 Final Certification**.

#### 4.1.2 Update POA&M - OSC Reapply

If any practices on the POA&M Review fail to result in a score of "MET," the Lead Assessor will recommend the OSC **NOT** be recommended for a CMMC Level 2 Final Certification. The Conditional CMMC Level 2 Certification will be rendered **null and void**.

### 4.2 Support POA&M Close-Out Assessment Appeal Resolution

The C3PAO holds the final interpretation authority for validating the OSC's CMMC POA&M Close-Out findings. If the OSC feels that technical error or an ethical violation compromised the process, the OSC can submit an appeal using the Assessment Appeals Process outlined in Appendix Q.
